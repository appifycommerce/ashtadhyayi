sutra: लुपि युक्तवद्व्यक्तिवचने
vRtti: लुपीति लुप्संज्ञया लुप्ततस्य प्रत्ययस्यार्थ उच्यते; तत्र लुपि युक्तवद्व्यक्ति वचने भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: When a _Taddhita_ affix is elided by using the word लुप्, then the gender and number (of the derivative word) agree with those of the original word.

This _sutra_ consists of four words: 1. लुपि, 'where there is a rejection by using लुप्'; 2. युक्तवत् 'appropriate to the same;' 3. व्यक्ति 'gender;' 4. वचनं 'number.' The form _vyakti_ _vachane_ is dual.

When a _Taddhita_ affix is _luped_, then the derivative word retains the gender and number of the primitive word. Note the difference between the rejection of a _Taddhita_ by saying 'let there be a लुक्' and 'let there be a लुप्' ॥ The direct action of both words is the rejection of the suffix; but a derivative formed by _luk_ rejection may not retain the number and gender of the original word; while a derivative formed by _lup_ rejection does retain the number and gender of the original word.

Thus in the secondary derivative word शिरीषाः, meaning 'a village not far away from शिरीष trees', the masculine gender and plural number of the original word has been retained, though made applicable to a village, which is in the singular number and neuter gender; similarly the word पंचालाः is masculine plural in form though applicable to a single province.

This _sutra_ is not an approved rule; as will be mentioned by _Panini_ in _sutra_ (1.2.53) following and is consequently of little practical importance.

Thus पंचालाः are a class of _Kshatriyas_. As such it is masculine gender and plural number. The country in which _Panchalas_ live is also called _Panchalas_; similarly कुरवः, मागधाः &c. There is a rule जनपदेलुप् ((4.2.81), the _lup_ takes the place of an affix when signifying the proper name of a country or kingdom). Thus पंचालाः + अण् (this is one of the affixes forming country) = पंचालाः.

This rule does not apply when the affix is suppressed by the word लुक् &c. and not लुप्. Thus लवणः सूपः 'salted soup', लवणायवागुः 'salted gruel,' लवणं शाकं 'salted vegetable.' Here the affix उक् has been elided by the word _luk_, by (IV. 4 24). लवणाल्लुक् (after the word _lavana_ the affix is _luked_).

These derivatives retain only the gender and number of the original, but no other quality. Thus as we have already seen that शिरीषाः, _sirishah_, is the name of a village and is formed by the _lup_ of the affix. Now compounding it with वन we have शिरीषवनम्, 'the forest of the village _Sirisha_.' Here the word शिरीषाः means village, and not trees. Had it meant trees called _sirisha_, then the न of वन would have become  ण optionally by Rule (8.4.6). (विभाषौषधि वनस्पतिभ्यः ॥ The न of the word वन is optionally changed into ण when preceded by words signifying annual herbs and trees).

Vart:- In the case of the words _Haritaki_ &c., the gender only is retained and not the number. As हरीतक्य फलानि 'the fruits of _Haritaki_. Here फलं is neuter in form, while हरीतकी is feminine.

Vart:- The words खलतिक &c. retain their number only but not gender, as खलतिकंवनानि 'mountain forests, i.e. forests in the vicinity of mountains.' Here खलतिकं is singular and वनानि plural, but the gender of both is the same viz. neuter.
