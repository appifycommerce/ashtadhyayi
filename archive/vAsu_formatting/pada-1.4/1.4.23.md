sutra: कारके
vRtti: कारक इत्यधिकारो वेदितव्यः, यदित ऊर्द्ध्वमनुक्रमिष्यामः कारक इत्येवं तद्वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: The phrase '_karaka_' (meaning 'in the special relation to a word expressing an action') is to be understood in the following aphorisms.

---
Any thing that helps towards the accomplishment of an action is a _karaka_. Thus in 'cooking,' the fire, the furnace, the vessel, the cook are all helpers in the accomplishment of the action. Thus '_Rama_ cooks food in a vessel, by the fire from the furnace for his master.' Here _Rama_ is agent _karaka_; 'food' is object _karaka_; 'vessel' is a locative _karaka_, fire is an instrumental _karaka_, 'furnace' is the ablative _karaka_ and 'master' is the dative _karaka_.

The word '_karaka_' thus is synonymous with the word cause (_hetu_) and occasion (_nimitta_). All the various causes and the occasions that are required to complete an action will be _karakas_. Out of the seven cases in which a sanskrit noun is declined, six represent such relation with an action. The Genitive or the sixth case can never be directly related with an action, and thus can never stand in the relation of a _karaka_ to a verb.
