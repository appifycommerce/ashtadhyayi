The verbs having similar meaning (_artha_) as the word _ruchi_ or 'liking' are रुच्यर्थ. A desire or longing caused by something else, is called _ruchi_. As देवदत्ताय रोचते मोदकः the sweet meat pleases _Devadatta_. यज्ञदत्ताय स्वदते ऽपूपः _Yajnadatta_ likes _Apupa_. Here _modaka_ is the agent that draws out the longing which is latent in _Devadatta_.

Why do we say 'the person pleased'? Observe देवदत्ताय रोचते मोदकः पथि. _Devadatta_ likes _modak_ in the way. The word _pathi_ being in the 7th case.
