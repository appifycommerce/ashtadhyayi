sutra: कणेमनसी श्रद्धाप्रतीघाते
vRtti: कणेशब्दो मनस्शब्दश्च श्रद्धा प्रतीघाते गतिसंज्ञौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The words _kane_ and _manas_ are _gati_ when in composition with a verb and used in the sense of reaction by satiation.

The word श्रद्धा-प्रतीघात means 'satisfaction of desire.' As कणेहत्य पयः पिबति he drinks milk to his heart's content or till he is satisfied ? So also मनोहत्य पयः पिबति. That is to say, he drinks so much till his desire (श्रद्धा) is satisfied by revulsion of feeling. When not having this sense we have कणे or मनोहत्वागतः he went away satisfied.
