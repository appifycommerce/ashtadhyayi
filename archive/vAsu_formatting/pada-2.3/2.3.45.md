sutra: नक्षत्रे च लुपि
vRtti: लुबन्तान्नक्षत्रशब्दात् तृतीयासप्तम्यौ विभक्तौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: When an affix declaring the time of an Asterism is elided by _lup_ (IV. 2. 4); the seventh and the third case-affixes are used after the word, whose affix is so elided.

Ex. पुष्येण पुष्ये वा पायसमश्नीयात् 'when the moon is in the Asterism of _Pushya_, let him drink milk.' See Rules (4.2.4) and (4.2.5). So also मघाभिः पललौदनं मघासु पललौदनम्. But not so here पंचालेषु वसति 'he lives in _Panchala_'. Here the country is meant, and not a star, though here also there is elision of the _Taddhita_ affix.

Why do we say '_lup_ elision'? Observe मघासु ग्रहः 'the planet in the _Magha_.' Here there is no elision. But why not in अद्यपुष्यः, अद्यकृत्तिका. Because they do not denote location, which is understood. It is when location is expressed by such words that we may use the third case-affix in the alternative.
