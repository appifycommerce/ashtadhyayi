sutra: आशिषि च
vRtti: आशिषि गम्यमानायां धातुमात्राद् वुन् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix वुन् is employed after all verbs, when benediction is intended.

As, जीव् + वुन् = जीवकः 'may he live'; नन्दकः 'may he be happy'.

The word आशीः means a sort of prayer; and it relates to action. The force of this affix is that of 'an agent with the addition that the action is simply the object of a prayer of some one who wishes that that may be the action of that agent'.
