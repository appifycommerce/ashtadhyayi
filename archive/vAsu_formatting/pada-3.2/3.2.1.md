sutra: कर्मण्यण्
vRtti: सर्वत्र कर्मण्युपपदे धातोरण्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् comes after a verbal root when the object, (of whatever sort it may be), is in composition with it, (as an _upapada_).

---
The object or _karma_ is of three sorts, namely _nivartya_, _vikarya_ and _prapya_.

The object which has a material cause, but such cause is however unexpressed in the sentence, is called _nivartya_ object; as कुम्भम् करोति 'he makes a pot'; here मृत् 'mud' the material cause of कुम्भ is unexpressed, therefore, कुम्भ is _nivartya_ object. Where the material cause itself is changed, by a modification, into something else, such an object is called _vikarya_ object; as काण्डलावः 'the branch-cutter'. While the object which cannot be approached by any action, and is not affected by it, but is always constant, is called the _prapya_ object; as a वेदाध्यायः 'the reading of _Veda_'; the _Veda_ is always the same.

They will be illustrated by the following examples:- Of the first kind, we have कुम्भकारः 'a potter' and  नगरकारः 'a city-builder'; of the second, we have काण्डलावः 'a branch-cutter' and शरलावः 'a reed-cutter'. Of the third, वेदाध्यायः 'the learning of _Veda_' and चर्चापाठः 'the reading of _Charcha_'. But compound nouns cannot be formed of such sentences as ग्रामं गच्छति 'he goes to the village', आदित्यं पश्यति 'he sees the sun', हिमवन्तं शृणोति 'he hears the _Himavat_'. The reason is that it is against the usage of the language to form nouns out of these.

Vart:- The affix ण comes after the verbs शील्, काम्, भक्ष्य and आचर and the noun in composition with it, retains its original accent. As मांसशीलः 'addicted to flesh', fem. मांसशीला; मांसकामः 'loving flesh', fem. मांसकामा; मांसभक्षः 'carnivorous', fem. मांसभक्षा; and कल्याणाचारः 'good-conducted', fem. कल्याणाचारा ।

Vart:- The affix ण comes after the roots ईक्ष 'to look' and क्षम् 'to forbear' under similar circumstances. As सुखप्रतीक्षः, fem. सुखप्रतीक्षा 'expecting happiness'; बहुक्षमः fem. बहुक्षमा 'much forbearing'.
