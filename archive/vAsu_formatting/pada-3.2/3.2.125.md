sutra: सम्बोधने च
vRtti: सम्बोधने च विषये लटः शतृशानचौ प्रत्ययौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes शतृ and शानच् are the substitutes of लट् even when agreeing with what ends with a first case-affix, provided that it is in the vocative case.

This aphorism declares when these participles may be employed even in the first case; as हे पचन् or हे पचमान 'O thou who art cooking'.
