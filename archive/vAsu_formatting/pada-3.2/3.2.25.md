sutra: हरतेर्दूतिनाथयोः पशौ
vRtti: दूति नाथ इत्येतयोः कर्मणोरुपपदयोः हरतेर्धातोः पशौ कर्तरि इन् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When the agent indicated is an animal, the affix इन् comes after the verb हृ 'to take', the object in composition with it being the words दूति 'a leather-bag' and नाथ 'a master'.

Thus दूतिहरिः 'a dog' (a carrier of skin); नाथहरिः 'a beast' (that carries its master).

When the words formed do not denote an animal, the affix अण् is employed; as दूतिहारः 'a water-carrier' (a carrier of a leather-bag for holding water). नाथहारः 'a carrier of his master'.
