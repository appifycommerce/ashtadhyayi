sutra: सोमे सुञः
vRtti: सोमे कर्मण्युपपदे सुनोतेर्धातोः क्विप्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्विप् comes after the verb सु 'to press out juice', with the sense of past time, when the word सोम, in the accusative case, is in composition.

As, सोमसुत् 'who has pressed the _soma_ juice, or _soma_-distiller'; 1st. dual सोमसुतौ; 1st. plural सोमसुतः ।

This _sutra_ is also for the sake of making a _niyama_ or restrictive rule. The four-fold restriction is here intended. i. e. as regards the verb, the tense, the _upapada_ and the affix.
