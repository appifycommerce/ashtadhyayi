sutra: अवे ग्रहो वर्षप्रतिबन्धे
vRtti: अव उपपदे ग्रहेर्धातोर्घञ्प्रत्ययो भवति विभाषा वर्षप्रतिबन्धेऽभिधेये ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ghan_' is optionally employed after the root '_grah_', when the word '_ava_' is in composition, the sense being witholding of rain.

---
The word 'optionally' is understood here. The word वर्षप्रतिबन्ध means the absence of rain, from some cause or another, when the season has arrived; as अवग्राहः or अवग्रहो देवस्य 'the draught of rain'.

Why do we say 'when meaning obstruction of rain'? Observe अवग्रहः पदस्य ।
