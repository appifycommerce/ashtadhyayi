sutra: क्वणो वीणायां च
vRtti: क्वणतेर्धातोर्निपूर्वादनुपसर्गाच्च वीणायां वा अप्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ap_' comes optionally after the verb '_kvan_' (to jingle), when '_ni_' is in composition with it, as well as when it is without any _upasarga_, or when 'flute' is meant.

This debars the affix घञ्. Thus निक्वणः or निक्वाणः 'a musical tone'. क्वणः or क्वाणः 'sound'. When it refers to 'flute', it must have some _upasarga_ not necessarily नि; as कल्याणप्रक्वणा वीणा.

But not so here, अतिक्वाणो वर्तते, where the _upasarga_ being अति and the word not referring to 'a flute', no option is allowed. When flute is not meant the _upasarga_ must be नि or no _upasarga_ at all, for the optional application of the affix अप्. To sum up, क्वण् takes अप् optionally under three conditions:- Ist when preceded by नि, or 2ndly when having no _upasarga_, or 3rdly when it refers to 'flute', and then it must have some _upasarga_.
