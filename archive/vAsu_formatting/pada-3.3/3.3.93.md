sutra: कर्मण्यधिकरणे च
vRtti: कर्मण्युपपदे घुसंज्ञकेभ्यो धातुभ्यः किःप्रत्ययो भवति, अधिकरणे कारके ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ki_' comes after a '_ghu_' verb, when a word in the accusative case is in composition with it, and when the relation of the word so formed to its verb, is that of 'location'.

---
As जलधिः 'the ocean (in which water is held)';  शरधिः 'a quiver (that in which arrows are put)'.

The word 'location' in the aphorism indicates that the words so formed should have no other significance. The word च in the aphorism draws in the affix कि from the last _sutra_.
