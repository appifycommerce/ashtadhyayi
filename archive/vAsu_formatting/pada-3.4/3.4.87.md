sutra: सेर्ह्यपिच्च
vRtti: लोडादेशस्य सेर्हि इत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the Imperative, '_hi_' is substituted for '_si_', and this has not the indicatory '_p_' of '_sip_', i. e., it is acutely accented.

---
The substitute being like the original expression (1. 1. 56), हि substituted for सिप्, would have been a पित् affix, but for this _sutra_, which clearly states in its latter portion that this हि is not to be regarded as having an indicatory प ।

Thus लुनीहि, पुनीहि, राध्नुहि, तक्ष्णुहि; and as this affix is अपित्, rule (1. 2. 4) makes it ङित् also, and thereby no _guna_ takes place.
