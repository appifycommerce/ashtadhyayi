sutra: वनो र च
vRtti: वन्नन्तात्प्रातिपदिकात् स्त्रियां ङीप् प्रत्ययोभवति रेफश्चान्तादेशः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix 'ङीप्' is added, in forming the feminine to the stems that end in the syllable वन्, and र् is the substitute of the final of such syllable.

Thus धीवन् (_Unadi_ IV. 115) f. धीवरी 'a female artisan'; पीवन् f. पीवरी 'a young woman, a stout woman', शर्वन् f. शर्वरी 'night' (शृ + वनिप् (3.2.75)) lit. that which destroys light. So also परलोकदृश्वरी ॥

Words ending in वन् are formed by the affixes ङ्वनिप्, (3.2.103) क्वनिप् and वनिप् (3.2.74) These words end in न् and consequently would have taken ङीप् even by (4.1.5); the necessity of the present _sutra_ arose in order to teach the change of न् into र् in case of words ending in वन् ॥

Vart:- If the affix वन् is ordained to be added to a word ending in हश्, (a letter of हश् _pratyahara_), and is thus immediately preceded by a soft consonant then this rule does not apply, that is to say, there is neither the application of the affix ङीप् nor the change of म् into र् ॥ Thus सहयुध्वन् is both masculine and feminine as, सहयुध्वा ब्राह्मणः or ब्राह्मणी 'a _Brahman_ brother or sister in arms'. In शर्वन् the वन् is preceded by र् which is a letter of हश् class, but as वन् is not ordained to be applied to शर् but to शृ, and we get the र् indirectly by _guna_, the _vartika_ does not apply to such a case. Hence शर्वरी ॥
