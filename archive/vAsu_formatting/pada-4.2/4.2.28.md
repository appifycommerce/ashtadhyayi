sutra: छ च
vRtti: अपोनप्तृ अपान्नप्तृ इत्येताभ्यां छकारः प्रत्ययो भवति सास्य देवतेत्यस्मिन्विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: Also '_Chha_' is added to '_Aponaptri_' and '_Apannaptri_' in the sense of 'that its deity'.

The affix छ also comes in the sense of "that its deity" after the word _Aponaptri_ and _Apannaptri_. This debars अण् ॥ Thus अपोनपत्रीयं or अपान्नप्त्रीयम् 'oblation sacred to _Aponapat_ or _Apannapat_'. This is made a separate _sutra_, in order to prevent the application of rule (1.3.10). For if it was included in the last, the _sutra_ would have run thus: "The affixes घ and छ come after _Aponaptri_ and _Apannaptri_", the meaning of which according to maxim 1.3.10 would have been "the affix घ comes after _Aponaptri_, and छ after _Apannaptri_". But this is not what the author intended. Hence two distinct _sutras_.

Vart:- The affix छ comes after the words पैंगाक्षीपुत्र &c. As, पैंगाक्षीपुत्रीयम्, तार्णबिन्दवीयम् ॥

Vart:- The word शतरुद्र takes घ and छ both : e. g. शतरुद्रीयम् and शतरुद्रियं ॥
