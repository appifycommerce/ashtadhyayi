sutra: कुलकुक्षिग्रीवाभ्यः श्वास्यलङ्कारेषु
vRtti: कुलकुक्षिग्रीवाशब्देभ्यो यथासंख्यं श्वन् असि अलंकार इत्येतेषु जातादिष्वर्थेषु ढकञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The same affix ढकञ् is added to the words कुल, कुक्षि and ग्रीवा, when the whole words so formed mean respectively, 'a dog', 'a sword' and 'an ornament'.

---
The force of the affix, as already told above, is to denote 'produce' &c. (4.3.25) &c)): but the whole word has specific significance. As कौलेयकः = a dog (lit. pertaining to a family); कौक्षेयकः = a sword (lit. remaining in a sheath), ग्रैवेयकः = a necklace. When not having these meanings; the regular derivatives from these words are formed by अण् as, कौलः, कौक्षः and ग्रैवः ॥
