sutra: गोश्च पुरीषे
vRtti: गोशब्दात्पुरीषे ऽभिधेये मयट् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix मयट् comes after the word गो in the sense of 'its dung.'

Thus गोमयम् 'cow dung'. 'Dung' is neither a modification nor a part of cow.
Therefore this separate _sutra_ for गो ॥ Why do we say meaning 'its dung'? Observe गव्यं = milk. The affix यत् here comes in the sense of product or part. (4.3.160), though strictly speaking 'milk' also is not an '_avayava_' or a '_vikara_' of गो ॥
