sutra: वासुदेवार्जुनाभ्यां वुन्
vRtti: वासुदेवार्जुनशब्दाभ्यां वुन् प्रत्ययो भवति सोस्य भक्तिरित्येतस्मिन्विषये । छाणोरपवादः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix वुन् comes in the sense of 'this is his object of veneration,' after the words '_Vasudeva_' and '_Arjuna_.'

This debars छ and अण् ॥ Thus वासुदेवकः, अर्जुनकः ॥

Q. The word वासुदेव being the name of a _Kshatriya_ would have taken by the next _sutra_, and there is no difference here between वुन् and वुञ्, why then include the word वासुदेव in this _sutra_?

A. The word वासुदेव here is the name of God (in which all dwell वसति अस्मिन्) and not the designation of a _Kshatriya_.

By the general rule of compounds (2.2.34) a word of fewer vowels is placed first, and so _Arjuna_ ought to have been placed first. The not doing so in this _sutra_ indicates (_jnapaka_) the existence of this rule 'that a word denoting an object of reverence is placed first. '
