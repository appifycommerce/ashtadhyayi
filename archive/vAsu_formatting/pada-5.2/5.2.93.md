vRtti_eng: The word _Indriyam_, (having _udatta_ on the last), is anomalous, meaning an organ of sense; and so called, either because it is 'the characteristic from which the existence of _Indra_ is inferred', or 'it is seen by _Indra_', or 'it is created by _Indra_', or 'it is wished for by _Indra_', or 'it is given by _Indra_'.

The word इंद्रिय is a primitive word, meaning organs of sense, such as eyes &c. Its derivation is obscure, if it is a derivative word at all. In the latter alternative, it may be said to be formed by the affix घच् added after इन्द्र, in the sense of either 'a mark thereof'. As इन्द्रस्य लिङ्गम् = इन्द्रियम् ॥ The senses (_indriyas_) are so called because, _Indra_ is _Atma_ or soul, and it is inferred by the existence of the senses, eyes, ears &c. So that these organs are the 'marks or signs or _linga_ of _Indra_ : because they being an instrument presupose an agent, there being no instrument without an agent.

Or the senses (_indriyas_) are so-called because they are 'seen or known by _Indra_ or _Atma_' (इन्द्रेण दृष्टं = ज्ञातं). The affix is here added to a word in the third case in construction. The knowing or perceiving of the senses by the Self is an allusion to the following _Sruti_ of the _Aitareya_ _Upanishad_ Chapter 111. verse 13, where the Self having created the physical body took a survey of it. स एतमेव पुरुषं ब्रह्म ततमम पश्यदिदमदर्शमिती "He beheld this _Brahma_ who dwells in the body who pervades everywhere, and exclaimed -- 'I have seen this'. Or they are so called because they are created by _Indra_ or _Atma_ (इन्द्रेण सृष्टं) i. e. the senses are formed according to the good and bad deeds of the Self. Or they are so called because they are wished for by _Indra_ or Self (इन्द्रेण जुष्टं सेवितं) as they are the gate-ways of knowledge. Or they are so called because they are given by _Indra_ (इन्द्रेण दत्तं) i. e. they are allotted to their respective objects by _Indra_ e. g. the eye is given to perceive forms, the ear to perceive sounds and so on. The word वा 'or' joins every one of the above. The word इति shows, that there may be other appropriate significations also: As, इन्द्रेण दुर्जयम् = इन्द्रियम् 'senses' -- difficult to be subdued by the Soul.
