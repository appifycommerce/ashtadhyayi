sutra: अह्नोह्न एतेभ्यः
vRtti: राजाहःसखिभ्यष्टजिति वक्ष्यति । तस्मिन् अहन्नित्येतस्याह्न इत्ययमादेशो भवति एतेभ्य उत्तरस्य ॥
vRtti_eng: For _ahan_ is substituted _ahna_, when preceded by the above words, (and taking the affix _tach_ to be mentioned in (V. 4. 91)).

When the affix टच् follows अहन्, and the latter is preceded by the words सर्व &c, then अह्न is substituted for अहन् ॥ By the term एतेभ्यः "these words", is meant the numerals (with the exception of एक (5.4.90)) the Indeclinables, the words सर्व, संख्यात and words denoting a part of a day, for these are the words mentioned in the last _sutra_. The word अहन् is also mentioned therein, but it is not taken here, for there can be no _Tatpurusha_ compound of अहन् with अहन् ॥ The word पुण्य is also excluded by (5.4.90). Thus द्वयोरह्नोर्भवः = द्व्यह्नः, त्र्यह्नः, अहरतिक्रान्तः = अत्यह्नः, निरह्नः ॥ So also सर्वाह्णः, (8.4.7), पूर्वाह्णः, अपराह्णः, संख्याताह्नः (according to some संख्याताहः (5.4.90)).

The ordaining of substitution is redundant according to the _Vartika_ _kara_. In his opinion, the _sutra_ अह्नः एतेभ्यः alone would have been enough. The meaning then would have been "the affix अच् comes after the word अहन् when preceded by these words सर्व &c". The adding of अच् would produce the same result: as द्वि + अहन् + अच् = द्वि + अह्न् + अच् (6.4.134) the middle अ of अहन् is elided)) = द्व्यह्नः ॥ The only specific result which टच् would have produced was to make the feminine of these words end in long ई (4.1.15), and the elision of the final अन् of अह्न (6.4.145). But the compounds of अहन् are masculine always (2.4.29), they can have no feminine: and as the desired form is द्व्यह्नः, the _sutra_ (6.4.145) cannot apply. The affix अच् is therefore, the proper affix and the substitution of अह्न for अहन् is redundant.
