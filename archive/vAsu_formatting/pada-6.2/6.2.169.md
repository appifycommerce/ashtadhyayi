sutra: निष्ठोपमानादन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: निष्ठान्तादुपमानवाचिनश्च मुखं स्वाङ्गमुत्तरपदमन्यतरस्यां बहुव्रीहौ समासेन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In a _Bahuvrihi_, the word मुख denoting 'an actual mouth', has optionally the acute on the final, when preceded by a participle in त, or by that wherewith something is compared.

Thus प्रक्षालितमुखः꣡ or प्रक्षालित꣡मुखः or प्र꣡क्षालितमुखः ॥ When the final is not acute, then Rule (6.2.110) applies which makes the first member have acute on the final optionally, and when that also does not apply, then by (6.2.1) the first member preserves its original accent, which is that of the _gati_ (6.2.49). Thus there are three forms. So also with a word denoting comparison:- सिंहमुखः꣡ or सिंह꣡मुखः, व्याघ्रमुखः꣡ or व्याघ्र꣡मुखः ॥
