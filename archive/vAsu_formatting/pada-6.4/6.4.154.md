sutra: तुरिष्ठेमेयस्सु
vRtti: इष्ठन् इमनिच् ईयसुन् इत्येतेषु परतः तृशब्दस्य लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix तृ is elided before the affixes इष्ठन्, इमनिच् and ईयसुन् ॥

---
Thus करिष्ठः, विजयिष्ठः, वहिष्ठः, दोहीयसी धेनुः ॥ The whole affix तृ is elided; otherwise only the last vowel (टि) with the following consonant would have been elided by the following rules. The _anuvritti_ of लुक् of the last aphorism should not be read into this, for had the elision taken place by लुक्, then the mark of the affix would also have disappeared likewise (1.1.63.), and there would have remained no _guna_ in विजयिष्ठ and करिष्ठ ॥ See (5.1.122), and (5.3.59); for these affixes. The affix इमन् has been read into this aphorism for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_, there being no example of तृ followed by इमन्; तृ is followed by इष्ठ and ईयस् by (5.3.59).
