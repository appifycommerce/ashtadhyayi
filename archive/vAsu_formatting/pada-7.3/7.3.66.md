sutra: यजयाचरुचप्रवचर्चश्च
vRtti: यज याच रुच प्रवच ऋच इत्येतेषां ण्ये परतः कवर्गादेशो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A guttural is not substituted for the final palatals of यज्, याच्, रुच्, प्र-वच्, and ऋच् before the affix ण्यत् ॥

As याज्यम्, वाच्यम्, रोच्यम्, प्रवाच्यम्, and अर्च्यम् ॥ Though ऋच् has a penultimate ऋ and therefore by (3.1.110) would have taken क्यप्, it takes ण्यत् by force of this _sutra_. प्रवच् shows that the present _sutra_ applies to it, though it means 'a word or speech', and the prohibition of (7.3.67) does not apply. प्रवाच्य is the name of a particular book. Others say that the prohibition applies to वच् only when it is preceded by प्र, and does not mean word or speech (7.3.67) and not when it is preceded by any other preposition. As अविवाक्यमहरिति पठन्ति ॥ This even in a very restricted sense, namely on the tenth day of the _Dasaratra_ ceremony. In other places we have अविवाच्यं ॥

Vart:- त्यज् should he enumerated in this connection i. e. before ण्यत्, the ज् remains unaltered, as त्याज्यम् ॥
