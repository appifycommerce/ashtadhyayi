sutra: ओतः श्यनि

As मिश्यति from शो, अवच्छयति from छो, अवद्यति from दो, and अवस्यति from सो ॥ The त् in ओत् is for the sake of euphony or ease of pronunciation.

According to _Padamanjari_, the _sutra_ should have been ओतः शिति, and thereby there would be the saving of half a _matra_, and also there would be no necessity of repeating the word शिति in (7.3.75).
