sutra: ऋतश्च संयोगादेर्गुणः
vRtti: ऋकारान्तस्याङ्गस्य संयोगादेर्गुणो भवति लिटि परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: A root ending in short ऋ, and preceded by a conjunct consonant, gets _Guna_ in the Perfect.

As सस्वरतुः, सस्वरुः from स्वृ, दध्वरतुः, दध्वरुः from ध्वृ, सस्मरतुः, सस्मरुः from स्मृ ॥ Why do we say ending in ऋ? Observe चिक्षियतुः, चिर्क्षियुः ॥ Why do we say beginning with a conjunct consonant? Observe चक्रतुः, चक्रुः ॥ This _sutra_ ordains _Guna_ where there was prohibition by (1.2.5) read with (1.1.5). But this does not debar the _Vriddhi_ caused by णल् (7.1.115). In fact, that prior rule supersedes this posterior rule, as सस्वार, दध्वार, सस्मार ॥ The word लिटि is to be supplied in the _sutra_, the rule does not apply to _Nishtha_ &c., as स्मृतः, स्मृतवान् ॥

Vart:- For the sake of कृञ्, the _guna_ should be stated even where the double-consonant is in the penultimate position and not in the beginning. As संचस्करतुः, संचस्करुः ॥ See (6.1.135). On the maxim पूर्वं धातुः साधनेन युज्यते पश्चादुपसर्गेण 'a root is first developed fully and then the preposition is added to it'; we first develop कृ in the Perfect by reduplication, which gives us चकृ + अतुस्, then we add the preposition as संचकृ + अतुः, then we add सुट् though the reduplicate intervenes, by (6.1.136) and (6.1.137), as संचस्कृ + अतुः, now the root assumes a form in which the penultimate begins with a double consonant, and applying the _vartika_ we make _guna_, and get संचस्करतुः ॥

It is by this consideration that in संस्कृषीष्ट, उपस्कृषीष्ट, the सुट् augment being _Bahiranga_ and consequently considered as non-existent (_asiddha_), there
is no इट् augment added by (7.2.43).
