sutra: तासस्त्योर्लोपः
vRtti: तासेरस्तेश्च सकारस्य सकारादौ प्रत्यये लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The final स् of तास् (the character of the second Future) and that of अस् 'to be', is elided before an affix beginning with स् ॥

As कर्त्तासि, कर्त्तासे, त्वमसि, ष्यति से ॥ See (6.4.111). In से the अ and स् both of अस् have been elided, the अ by (6.4.111), and स् by the present _sutra_,so that the mere suffix से remains, which however here is a finite verb: hence the स, is not changed to ष ॥ See (8.3.111).
