As तन्तन्यते and तन्तनीति; जङ्गम्यते and जङ्गमीति, यंयम्यते and यंयमीति; रंरम्यते and रंरमीति ॥ The augment न् here should be considered as _anusvara_, because an _adesa_ is indicated by the nature of the _sthanin_ which is replaced; and therefore in यंयम्यते, it remains _anusvara_. Had it been म्, it could not have been changed to _anusvara_ in यंयम्यते, रंरम्यते (See (8.3.24)). In तन्तन्यते &c, the _anusvara_ is changed to न्, ङ् &c, by (8.4.58); the other forms तन्तन्यते तंतनीति, जंगम्यते, जंगमीति are derived by the following :-

Vart:- This _anusvara_ should be treated as if it was at the end of a _Pada_ or word. That being so, (8.4.59) applies, and we have the _anusvara_ unchanged, as in तंतन्यते &c.

Why do we say "after a short अ"? Observe तेतिम्यते ॥ The त् in अत् indicates that the augment will not be added to a reduplicate which once was long आ but became short by (7.4.59) as from भाम 'to be angry', is बाभाम्यते, (the second lengthening takes place by (7.4.83)). Why do we say ending in a nasal? Observe पापच्यते ॥
