sutra: अङ्गाप्रातिलोम्ये
vRtti: अङ्ग इत्यनेन युक्तं तिङन्तमप्रातिलोम्ये गम्यमाने नानुदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The finite verb retains its accent in connection with अङ्ग when used in a friendly assertion.

Anything done to injure another is _prati_-_loma_, opposite of this is _apratiloma_, or friendliness. In fact, it is equal to _anuloma_. Thus अङ्ग प꣡च 'yes, you may cook', Here _anga_ has the force of friendly permission. So also अङ्ग प꣡ठ ॥ But when it has the force of _pratiloma_, we have:- अङ्ग कूजा꣡ ३ वृषल ॥ इदानीं ज्ञास्यसि जाल्म "Well, chuckle O sinner! soon wilt thou learn, O coward". Here अङ्ग is used in the sense of censure, for chuckling is a thing not liked by the person: and is _pratiloma_ action: for _pluta_-vowel see (8.2.96).
