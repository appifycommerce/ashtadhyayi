sutra: चवायोगे प्रथमा
vRtti: अगतेरिति पूर्वसूत्रे चानुकृष्टमित्यत्र नानुवर्त्तते । च वा इत्येताभ्यां योगे प्रथमा तिङ्विभक्तिर्नानुदात्ता भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The first finite verb only retains its accent in connection with च and वा ॥

The _anuvritti_ of अगतेः which was drawn in the last _sutra_, does not run into this. Thus गर्दभांश्च काल꣡यति, वीणां च वा॒द॒य॒ति॒ ॥ गर्दभान् वा काल꣡यति, वीणां वा वा॒द॒य॒ति॒ ॥

The word योग in the _sutra_ indicates that the mere connection with the verb is meant, whether this connection takes place by adding these words च and वा, before the verb, or after the verb, is immaterial for the purposes of this _sutra_, (not so in the last). The word प्रथमा shows that the first verb is governed by this rule and not the second.
