sutra: उदन्वानुदधौ च
vRtti: उदन्वानित्युदकशब्दस्य मतावुदन्भावो निपात्यते उदधावर्थे संज्ञायां विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: The word उदन्वान् is irregularly formed, in the sense of 'a sea'.

---
It is derived from उदक 'water' with the affix मत् ॥ उदन्वान् is the name of a _Rishi_, because he controlled the rains, it rained at his command. It also means occan or that in which water is held, like तटाक &c. The affix कि is added by (III. 3 93), and उदक changed to उद् by (6.3.58), and thus we have उदधिः ॥ Why do we say "when meaning a sea"? Observe उदकवान् घटः 'a pot having water'. Here the main idea is not that of "holding or containing", but simply the general fact of possessing water: a human being may also possess water in the same way.
