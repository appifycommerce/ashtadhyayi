sutra: हलि सर्वेषाम्
vRtti: हलि परतो भोभगोअघोअपूर्वस्य यकारस्य पदान्तस्य लोपो भवति सर्वेषामाचार्याणां मतेन ॥
vRtti_eng: (The य् preceded by भो, भगो, अघो, or by अ or आ, being final in a _pada_, is elided) before a consonant, according to the opinion of all _Acharyas_.

Thus भो हसति, भगो हसति, अघो हसति; भो याति, भगो याति अघो याति, वृक्षा हसन्ति ॥ Though the _anuvritti_ of व् and य् both is present here, yet we have taken य only to the exclusion of व् ॥ Because भो, भगो and अघो there is य् only, and never व्; and व् can come only when preceded by अ or आ : the only example of which given by Grammarians is वृक्षव् करोति (8.3.17). Here व् is not elided, because the word अशि qualifies the word हलि of this _sutra_.

Question:- But व् should be elided in वृक्षव् हसति, because ह is an अश् letter.

Answer:- There is no such example to be found in any standard author. Moreover _Patanjali_ in his commentary on the _Pratyahara_ _sutra_ लण् says that no words can end in ह्, य्, र्, व् or ल् ॥ So that the existence of the very word वृक्षव् is doubtful.

The word _sarvesham_ indicates that (8.3.18), even does not apply, and there is no light articulation, but _lopa_ there too.
