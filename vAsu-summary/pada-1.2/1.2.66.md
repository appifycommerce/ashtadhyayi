sutra: स्त्री पुंवच्च
vRtti: स्त्री वृद्धा यूना सहवचने शिष्यते तल्लक्षणश्चेदेव विशेषो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And so also a feminine word, ending with a _vriddha_ affix, when similarly spoken along with the same word but which ends with a _yuvan_ affix, is only retained; and it is treated like a masculine.
