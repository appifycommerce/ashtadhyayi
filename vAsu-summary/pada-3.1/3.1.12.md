sutra: भृशादिभ्यो भुव्यच्वेर्लोपश्च हलः
vRtti: भृश इत्येवमादिभ्यः प्रातिपदिकेभ्योऽच्वन्तेभ्यो भुवि भवत्यर्थे क्यङ् प्रत्ययो भवति, हलन्तानां च लोपः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्यङ् in the sense of becoming what the thing previously was not, is employed after the crude forms भृश् and the rest, which do not end with the affix च्वि (V. 4. 50); and there is elision (_lopa_) of the final consonant of these words, if they end in a consonant.
