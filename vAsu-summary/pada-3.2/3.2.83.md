sutra: आत्ममाने खश्च
vRtti: अत्ममाने वर्त्तमानान्मन्यतेः सुप्युपपदे खश्प्रत्ययो भवति, चकाराण्णिनिश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: And the affix खश् comes after the verb मन् 'to think' when the word in composition with it is a word with a case-affix, and when it is employed to signify thought, whereof the object is self (the sense of the affix being 'thinking himself as such').
