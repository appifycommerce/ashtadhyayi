sutra: भाववचनाश्च
vRtti: भावइति प्रकृत्य ये घञादयो विहितास्ते च भाववचना भविष्यतिकाले क्रियायामुपपदे क्रियार्थायां भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: And the affixes that are ordained to come after a root with the force of denoting the mere action of the verb, such as घञ् &c. (III. 1. 13.) have also the force of the future, when the word in construction therewith, is another verb denoting an action performed for the sake of the future action.
