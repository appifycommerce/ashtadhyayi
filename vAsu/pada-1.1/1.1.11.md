sutra: ईदूदेद्विवचनम् प्रगृह्यम्
vRtti: ईत् उत् एत् इत्येवमन्तं द्विवचनं शब्दरूपं प्रगृह्यसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A dual case affix ending in ई or ऊ or ए is called _Pragrihya_, or excepted vowels which do not admit of _sandhi_ or conjunction.

As a general rule, Sanskrit allows of no hiatus in a sentence. If a word ends in a vowel, and the next word begins with a vowel, the two vowels coalesce, according to certain rules. This is called _sandhi_. But _pragrihyas_ are exceptions to this _sandhi_, "they are certain terminations, the final vowels of which are not liable to any _sandhi_ rules." (6.1.125). This _sutra_ gives three of these terminations, viz., the duals of nouns or verbs ending in ई (ईत्), ऊ (ऊत्), ए (एत्). Thus:- कवी इमौ "these two poets," so also वायू इति "two winds;" माले इति "these two garlands." पचेते इति "they two cook" पचेथे इति "you two cook." Here according to the general rule of _sandhi_, the final इ of कवी and the initial इ of इमौ ought to have coalesced into an ई, but it is not so, because कवी is the nominative dual of कवि.

Why do we say ending in _ī_, _ū_ and _e_? Because when the dual ends in any other vowel this rule will not apply. As वृक्षौ+अत्र = वृक्षावत्र, "these two trees" (6.1.78). Of course it follows from the definition, that ई, ऊ, or ए of the dual number only are _pragrihya_; if these vowels terminate any other number they will not be _pragřihya_ but will follow the general rule of _sandhi_, as कुमारी (I.S.) + अत्र = कुमार्य्यत्र, "the girl is here" (6.1.77).

_Vart_: The prohibition of मनीव &c., should be stated in treating of the _pragrihya_ nature of ई, ऊ &c. Thus मनी (two gems) + इव = मनीव "like two gems". So also दम्पतीव "like a couple," जम्पतीव "like man and wife," रोदसीव "like heaven and earth." Some say that this _vårtika_ is unneccessary. Because the final member of the above words is not इव, but the particle व only; which has the same meaning as _iva_.
