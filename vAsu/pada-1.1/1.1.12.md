sutra: अदसोमात्
vRtti: अदसः सम्बन्धी यो मकारस्तस्मात् पर ईदूदेतः प्रगृह्यसंज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: (The same letters) after the म् of the pronoun अदस् are _Pragrihya_.
---
In the pronoun अदस्, the dual termination in ई, ऊ or ए will be _pragrihya_ by force of the last _sūtra_, but the present _sûtra_ makes this addition, that in the case of अदस्, all terminations ending in ई, ऊ or ए and preceded by म, of whatever number they may be, will be _pragrihya_. As a matter of fact, there are only two such terminations satisfying the above conditions namely अमी and अमू. The rule may therefore be put in the following words of Dr. Max Muller:- "The terminations of अमी and अमू nom. plur. masc. and nom. dual of the pronoun अदस् are _pragrihya_." As अमी अश्वाः "Those horses", and अमू आसते. There is no example of the word _adas_ ending in ए.

Why do we say "of the word _adas_"? The letters ई, ऊ, ए following after the म् of any other word will not be _pragrihya_. As शमी+अत्र = शम्यत्र "this _sami_ tree."

Why do we say "after the letter म्"? Because in the example अमुके+अत्र = अमुकेऽत्र, "those here," the ए, preceded not by म् but by the क of अकच् (V.3.71) is not _pragrihya_, which it would have been by the influence of _sūtra_ II, which includes ए as well as ई and ऊ, and from which the word dual is not supplied here, else this rule would be useless.
