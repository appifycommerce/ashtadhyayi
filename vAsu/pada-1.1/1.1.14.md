vRtti: एकश्चासावच्च एकाच् निपातो य एकाच् आङ्वर्जितः स प्रगृह्यसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A particle (I.4.56) consisting of a single vowel, with the exception of the particle आङ् is a _Pragrihya_.

This _sūtra_ consists of three words: निपातः "particle", एकाच् "consisting of one vowel," अनाङ् "with the exception of आङ्."

All such particles technically called _nipäta_ (I.4.56) which consist of a simple vowel without any consonant, are _pragřihya_ and therefore are not liable to the rules of _sandhi_. As इ इन्द्र "Oh, _Indra_" उ उत्तिष्ठ "O arise."

It follows from the above definition that those _nipätas_ which consist of two or more letters, vowel and consonant, are not _pragrihya_, e. g. प्र in प्राग्नये वाचमीरय.

आङ् which is not a _pragrihya_, has four significations:- As a diminutive particle when joined to adjectives and nouns, as आ+उष्णम् = ओष्णम् "little hot, tepid" (2) as a prefix to verbs, it expresses the senses of "near" "nearto," and with verbs of "motion," "taking" &c., it shows the reverse of the action, as गम् 'to go', आगम 'to come;' आ+इहि = एहि, (3) as showing the limit inceptive (अभिविधि) "from," "ever since," as आजन्मनः "ever since his birth," (4) as showing the limit exclusive (मर्यादा), "till" "until" as आ+अध्ययनात् = आध्ययनात्, "until the reading begins." When the particle आ has not any one of the above four senses and is used in expressing regret &c., it is a _pragrihya_, as आ एवं किलासीत् "Ah! such there once was", आ एवं मन्यसे "Oh! do you think so."

The word एकाच् in this aphorism has a peculiar meaning. It means "consisting of one vowel and nothing else." In other words, the vowels themselves when used as निपात, e. g. आ, उ, इ &c. But the term एकाच् has a wider signification than that given to it in this _sūtra_. It means "a word or a portion of a word consisting of one vowel which can be pronounced at once"- in other words एकाच् means a "syllable". In that sense the words प्र, नि, वि &c., will also be एकाच्, but not so here. Therefore the rule of _sandhi_ will apply to them, thus प्राग्नये वाचमीरय. See _sūtra_ (VI.1.1) where the word एकाच् means a monosyllable.

Why do we say "a _nipata_?" Because if the single vowel is not a particle, but something else, an affix &c., then it will not be a _pragrihya_, as the final अ in चकार "he did", is the affix of third person perfect tense, and is liable to _sandhi_; as चकारात्र.
