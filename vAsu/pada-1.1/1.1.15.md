sutra: ओत्
vRtti: ओदन्तो यो निपातः स प्रगृह्यसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The final ओ of a particle is a _pragrihya_.
---
This _sútra_ consists of one word ओत् the final त् is a surplusage. The words "_pragrihya_" and "_nipåta_" are to be supplied from the preceding _sutras_ to complete the sense. The meaning is that those particles which end in ओ though consisting of several letters, are _pragrihya_. As अहो अपेहि "Halloo, go away."
