sutra: सम्बुद्धौ शाकल्यस्येतावनार्षे
vRtti: सम्बुद्धिनिमित्तो य ओकारः स शाकल्यस्याचार्यस्य मतेन प्रगृह्यसंज्ञो भवति, इति शब्देऽनार्षे अवैदिके परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The final ओ of the vocative singular (II.3.49) before the word इति according to _Sakalya_, in secular or non-vedic literature, is _pragrihya_."

This _sūtra_ gives the opinion of the _Rishi_ _Sakalya_, so that it is an optional rule. Thus both forms वायविति (formed according to the general rule of _sandhi_) and वायो इति (where ओ is _pragrihya_) are correct.

In _ârsha_ literature the _sandhi_ is imperative, not optional, as एता गा ब्रह्मबन्धवित्यब्रवीत्.

The mention of the name of any sage, such as that of _Sakalya_ in this _sūtra_, serves generally one of the two purposes :- (1) either it makes the rule an optional one, _vibhåshartham_, or (2) the mention is merely for the sake of showing respect to the particular sage, the rule would have stood as well without such mention; _pujártham_, as the word _Kåsyapa_ in _sutra_ (I.2.15).
