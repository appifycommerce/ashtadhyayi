sutra: ऊँ
vRtti: उञ इतावनार्षे ऊँ इत्ययमादेशो भवति दीर्घोऽनुनासिकः शाकल्यस्य मतेन प्रगृह्यसंज्ञकश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: The particle ऊँ replaces उञ् in non-vedic literature, and it is a _pragrihya_ in the opinion of _Sakalya_.

Before the word इति the word ऊञ् is replaced sometimes by ऊँ the long nasal _ū_. Thus ऊँ+इति = ऊँ इति or विति.

In some authorities the _sûtras_ (I.1.17) and (I.1.18) form but one _sūtra_, and then it is divided by the method of _yoga_-_vibhága_, the division of a single _sūtra_ into two separate _sûtras_ having two distinct rules.
