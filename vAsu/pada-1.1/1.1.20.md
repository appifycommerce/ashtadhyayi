sutra: दाधाघ्वदाप्
vRtti: दारूपाश्चत्वारो धातवो धारूपौ च द्वौ दाब्दैपौ वर्जयित्वा घुसंज्ञका भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The verbs having the form of _dà_ 'to give' and _dhā_ 'to place,' are called _ghu_.

This defines the word _ghu_. Four verbs have the form of दा, or assume it by the application of (6.1.45), and two, of धा; they are called घु. The _ghu_ verbs have certain peculiarities of conjugation to be described hereafter.

The घु verbs are the following:- डुदाञ् "to give," as प्रणिददाति; दाण् "to give," as, प्रणिदाता; दो "to cut," as, प्रणिद्यति; देङ् "to pity" as, प्रणिदयते, डुधाञ् "to place" as प्रणिदधाति, धेट् to "feed" as, प्रणिधयति.

In the above examples, because of the verbs being घु, the न of प्रनि is changed into ण by (8.4.17).

Similarly दाप् "to cut" and दैप् "to clean" not being called घु, rules (7.4.46) and (7.4.47) do not apply to them. Thus दा+क्त = दातं 'what is cut,' as, दातं बर्हिः. So also अवदातं "washed" as, अवदातं मुखं "a bright face." But with दा "to give," &c. दा+क्त = दद्+त (7.4.46) = दत्तः "given;" so also we have प्र+दा+क्त = प्रत्तम् (7.4.47). The word घु occurs in _sûtra_ (6.4.66), &c. The word _dåp_ includes also _daip_ by the _paribhâshâ_ given under (3.4.19), ऐ changed into आ by (6.1.45).
