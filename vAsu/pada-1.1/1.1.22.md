sutra: तरप्तमपौ घः
vRtti: तरप् तमप् इत्येतौ प्रत्ययौ घ संज्ञौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes _tarap_ and _tamap_ are called घ.

---
This _sutra_ defines घ affixes. They are two, तर and तम, the प् in them being इत्. The special use of these affixes will be described later on. These affixes are useful in forming the comparative and the superlative degrees respectively of adjectives, adverbs, &c. The base undergoes certain changes before these terminations, which will be treated of in its proper place.

Thus the words कुमारितरा and कुमारितमा are formed by adding the affixes तर and तम to the word or 'a girl,' whose long ई is shortened before these affixes by _sutra_ 43 of the third chapter of the 6th Book.
