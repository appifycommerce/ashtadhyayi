sutra: डति च
vRtti: डत्यन्ता या संख्या सा षट्संज्ञा भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And the _sankhyas_ ending with the affix _dati_ are called _shat_.

This _sutra_ enlarges the scope of the definition of षट् by including in it, words formed by डति. By _sutra_ 22, words in डति are already _sankhya_; by this they are also षट्. Therefore we have कति पठन्ति, 'how many are reading,' कति पश्य 'see how many.' Here कति has lost its plural termination by (7.1.22).
