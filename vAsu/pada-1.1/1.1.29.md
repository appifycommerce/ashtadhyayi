sutra: न बहुव्रीहौ
vRtti: बहुव्रीहौ समासे सर्वादीनि सर्वनामसंज्ञानि न भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The words _sarva_ &c., are not _sarvanama_ when occurring in a _bahuvrihi_ compound.

---
As a general rule (see _sutra_ (1.1.72)), when any definition, rule, operation &c. is made applicable to a particular word, the same would also apply to any other word which ends in that word. Thus the plural of man being 'men' in English, the plural of blackman will be blackmen. So the definition of _sarvanama_ given to _sarva_ &c., separately, will also apply to the words ending in _sarva_ &c.

This _sutra_ introduces thus an exception to _sutra_ (1.1.27). In _bahuvrihi_ or possessive compounds, the nature of which compounds will be described later on, the above mentioned words are not pronominals, and must follow the ordinary rule of declension. Thus the compound प्रियविश्व meaning 'beloved of all' is a _bahuvrihi_ compound of प्रिय 'beloved,' and विश्व 'all,' (which is a _sarvanama_). The declension of this compound will follow the general rule. Thus, in the dative singular, we have प्रियविश्वाय, though the dative singular of विश्व by itself is विश्वस्मै, like other pronominals. So also प्रियोभयाय "to him who is beloved of both." So also द्व्यन्याय, त्र्यन्याय &c.

Similarly in _bahuvrihi_ compounds, these words not being treated as pronominals, they do not take also the special affix अकच्, but the general affix कन्. As, त्वत्कपितृको, मत्कपितृको (5.3.70).

Though the word _bahuvrihi_ was present in this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from the last aphorism, the object of using the word _bahuvrihi_ again in this _sutra_, is this :-- that the prohibition may apply to those expressions also which are no longer _bahuvrihi_, but whose original components were once _bahuvrihi_. Thus the words वस्त्रान्तरा and वसनान्तरा are _bahuvrihi_ compounds; but when these two words are further compounded into a _dvandva_ compound, the present rule still applies. As, वस्त्रान्तरावसनान्तराः ॥
