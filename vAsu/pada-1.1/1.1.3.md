sutra: इको गुणवृद्धी
vRtti: वृद्धिगुणौ स्वसंज्ञया (वृद्ध्या गुणेन वा) शिष्यमाणाविक एव स्थाने वेदितव्यौ ॥
vRtti_eng: In the absence of any special rule, whenever _guna_ or _vriddhi_ is enjoined about any expression by using the terms _guna_ or _vriddhi_, it is to be understood to come in the room of the _ik_ vowels only. (_i_, _u_, _ri_, and _li_ long and short,) of that expression.

---
This is a _paribhasha_ _sutra_, and is useful in determining the original letters, in the place of which the substitute _guna_ and _vriddhi_ letters will come. The present rule will apply where there is the specification of no other particular rule.

Thus _sutra_ (7.3.84) declares:- "when a _sarvadhatuka_ or an _ardhadhatuka_ affix follows there is _guna_ of the base." Here the _sthani_ or the original expression which is to be _gunated_, is not specified, and to complete the sense, the word "_ikah_" must be read into the _sutra_. The rule then being, "when a S. or an A. affix follows there is _guna_ of the _ik_ vowels of the base." The _guna_ of इ or ई is ए; of उ or ऊ, is ओ, of ऋ or ॠ is अर्, of ऌ is अल्; and their _Vrddhi_ is ऐ, औ, आर् and आल् respectively. Thus नी + अति = ने + अति = नयति "he leads."

Therefore, wherever in any rule in this Grammar, _guna_ or _vriddhi_ is ordained by employing the terms _guņa_ or _vriddhi_, there the word "_ikah_" in the genitive case, meaning "in the place of _ik_", is to be supplied to complete the sense.

The word '_ik_' is thus understood in the following rules, and is there qualified by the term अङ्ग or 'base':- मिदेर्गुणः (7.3.82) मृजेर्वृद्धिः (7.2.114) पुगन्तलघूपध &c., (7.3.86); ऋच्छत्यॄताम् (7.4.11) ऋदृशोऽङि गुणः (7.4.16) स्थूलदूरयुव &c., (6.4.156).

In the following _sutras_, the term '_ik_' is understood and qualifies the word _ånga_ or base, जुसि च (7.3.83), सार्वधातुकार्धधातुकयोः (7.3.84).

These _sutras_ will be explained in their proper places.

The word '_ik_' has been used in the _sutra_ to show that the long आ, एच् or the diphthongs and हल् or the consonants, are not to take _guna_ or _vriddhi_ by this rule, as in the following examples यानम् "a carriage", ग्लायति "he feels aversion", उम्भिता "confined".

Here ग्लायति is formed by adding the affix तिप्, third person singular termination, with the class a affix शप्, to the root ग्लै; as ग्लै+शप्+तिप्=ग्लै+अ+ति. At this stage, rule (7.3.84), would require the _guna_ substitution of the vowel of the base before the _sarvadhatuka_ termination अ; the _guna_ substitute of ऐ being ए, there would be ग्ले+अति=ग्लयति. But this is wrong, the letter ऐ, being not included in the _pratyâhåra_ _ik_, is not affected by rule (7.3.84), and there is no _guna_ substitution in this case. Similarly there is no change in the long आ of यानम्. Thus या+ल्युट् (3.3.115) = यानम् (7.1.1). Here had there been _guņa_ by Rule (7.3.84), the आ of या, would have been changed into अ, and the form would have been यनम् which is wrong. But it is not so, as आ is not an इक् vowel. So also उम्भ्+इता = उम्भिता. Here, there is no _guna_ substitution in the place of the consonant भ्.

The repetition of the words _guna_ and _vriddhi_ in this _sútra_, (though by अनुवृत्ति or the supplying of a word from the previous _sūtra_, these words followed from the two preceding _sutras_) is for the purpose of indicating that, this is a restrictive rule applicable only there, where _guņa_ or _vriddhi_ has been ordained by the employment of the words _guna_ or _vriddhi_. Therefore, it is not so in the following cases :- द्यौः "sky", पन्थाः "way" सः "he," इमम् "this". द्यौः is the nominative singular of the base दिव्. It is formed by rule (7.1.84), which declares that "in the nominative singular the letter औ takes the place of दिव्". Here the letter औ is no doubt a _vriddhi_ letter, but as this substitution is not enjoined by the enunciation of the term _vriddhi_, औ does not take the place of the vowel इ of दिव्, but it replaces the final व्. Thus दि+औ+स्=द्यौः.

Similarly rule (7.1.85), declares that of the word पथिन्, आ is the substitute. The आ is a _vriddhi_ letter no doubt, but not being enunciated by the term _vriddhi_, it takes the place of न् of पथिन् and not of इ. Thus we have पन्थाः, the न being added by (7.1.87).

Similarly सः from तद्, which is formed by (7.2.102) "short अ is the substitute of _tyad_, &c.," Here अ takes the place of द्. Thus we have त, which is changed again into स by (7.2.106).
