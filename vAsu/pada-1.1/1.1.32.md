sutra: विभाषा जसि
vRtti: द्वन्द्वे समासे जसि विभाषा सर्वादीनि सर्वनामसंज्ञानि न भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: "(Their _dvandva_ compounds) are optionally _sarvanama_ when the nominative plural termination _jas_ follows."

This is a proviso to _sutra_ (I. 1. 31), and declares that before the termination जस् (which is the termination of the nominative plural, as we shall find later on, and which in the pronominals is replaced by शी), the _dvandva_ compounds may be treated either as _sarvanamas_ or as ordinary words. Thus the plural of वर्णाश्रमेतर may be either  वर्णाश्रमेतराः or ०तरे, that is, the word may take either जस् or शी.

This _sutra_ governs the four succeeding _sutras_. The option allowed in the case of the application of the affix Ist pl. to the _dvandva_ compounds of pronominals, does not extend to the _dvandva_ compounds of pronominal which take the affix अकच् (V. 3. 71). There the _sutra_ (I. 1. 31) is absolute. Thus, कतरः + कतमकः = कतरकतमकाः in the plural. This affix अक (अकच्) comes before the last vowel, with what follows it, of the pronominals and indeclinables.
