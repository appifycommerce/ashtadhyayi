sutra: प्रथमचरमतयाल्पार्द्धकतिपयनेमाश्च
vRtti: प्रथम चरम तय अल्प अर्द्ध कतिपय नेम इत्येतेजसि विभाषा सर्वनामसंज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: And also the words _prathama_ 'first'; _charama_ 'last,' words ending with the affix _taya_ (V. 2. 42); _alpa_ 'few' _ardha_ 'half' _katipaya_ 'some,' and _nema_ 'half' are optionally _sarvanama_, before the nom. pl. termination.

Thus we have प्रथमे or प्रथमाः, चरमे or चरमाः, अल्पे or अल्पाः, अर्द्धे or अर्द्धाः, कतिपये or कतिपयाः, नेमे or नेमाः, द्वितये or द्वितयाः ॥

The words "optionally when the affix जस् follow" are understood in this _sutra_. The governing force of the word "_dvandva_" does not extend to this, and stops at this. By the word तय in the aphorism, is meant words ending in the affix तय. The rest are _pratipadikas_ or crude bases. The word नेम has already been enumerated among the pronominals, therefore, the option in its case, is what is called _prapta_-_vibhasa_, the result of which will be that though in the nom. pl. it may be declined like नर, the rest of its declension is like _sarva_, while in the case of _prathama_ &c. the nom. pl. may be like _sarva_, but the rest of their declension must be like that of _nara_. The word _ubhaya_, has been formed by the addition of the affix तय, and it is already enumerated in the list of pronominals, therefore, by the present _sutra_ its nom. pl. admits of two forms.

The application of the affix _kan_ or _akach_ must depend upon the nature of these words, if pronominals, then _akach_, otherwise _kan_.
