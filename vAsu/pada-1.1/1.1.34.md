sutra: पूर्वपरावरदक्षिणोत्तरापराधराणि व्यवस्थायामसंज्ञायाम्
vRtti: पूर्वादीनि विभाषा जसि सर्वनामसंज्ञानि भवन्ति व्यवस्थायामसंज्ञायाम् ॥
vRtti_eng: The words _purva_ 'prior', _para_ 'after,' avara 'posterior,' _dakshina_ 'south,' _uttara_ 'north.' _apara_ 'other,' and _adhara_ 'inferior,' when they discriminate relative position, not when they are appellatives, are optionally _sarvanama_ before the affix _jas_.

These seven words have already been mentioned in the list of _sarvanamas_. They are always _sarvanamas_, when they have the meaning given to them in the list, i. e., when they imply a relation in time and space, but when used in any other sense than the one which has been determined or fixed for them, they are not _sarvanamas_, nor are they so when they are used as appellatives (संज्ञा). Thus, when the word दक्षिण means 'clever,' it is not a _sarvanama_, as, दक्षिणा इमे गायकाः 'these clever minstrels,' similarly in उत्तराः कुरवः 'the northern _Kurus_,' the word उत्तर is not a pronominal, for though it declares a direction, it is a proper noun.

When these seven words are _sarvanama_, they are declined like _sarva_, except in the nominative plural, when they may be declined either as _sarvanamas_, or as ordinary nouns. The option allowed in the case of these words is a _praptavibhasa_.

That there is a 'specification' (_niyama_), or tacit implication, of a determinate point (_avadhi_), with reference to which something is to be described by the word itself, is what we mean when we say "that a relation in time or place (_avastha_) is implied." For example, if we wish to describe Benares as being southern (_dakshina_), to do this, we may specify some point, say one of the peaks of the _Himalaya_ with reference to which Benares may be described as a "place to the southward." Again we in the north may thus speak of the people to the south of the _Vindhya_ mountains, as being southern, not with reference to the inhabitants of Ceylon, but with reference (as every one here understands by tacit implication) to us ourselves, who live to the north the _Vindhya_ range. Thus, (पूर्वे or पूर्वाः, अवरे or अवराः, परे or पराः) दक्षिणे or दक्षिणे or दक्षिणाः; उत्तराः; अपरे or अपराः; अधरे or अधराः.
