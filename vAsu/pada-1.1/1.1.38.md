sutra: तद्धितश्चासर्वविभक्तिः
vRtti: तद्धितान्तः शब्दोऽसर्वविभक्तिरव्ययसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And the words ending in _taddhita_ or secondary affixes (IV. 1. 76.) which are not declined in all the cases are also indeclinables.

This expands the definition of _avyaya_. There are three words in the _sutra_ _taddhitah_, _cha_ and _asarva_-_vibhaktih_. _Taddhitas_ or secondary affixes are certain affixes, by which nouns are derived from other nouns, such as, from मनु we have मानवः, _sarva_-_vibhaktis_ are those words which take all case-terminations, _asarva_-_vibhaktis_ are those which do not take all _vibhaktis_ but some only. Thus the adverb यतः is declined in the singular ablative only, and does not take the dual and plural terminations.

Those derivative words which do not take all the case-terminations, but only some of them and which are formed by the addition of _Taddhita_ affixes are indeclinables. As ततः 'thence,' तत्र 'there.' Both these words are formed by _taddhita_ affixes from the pronoun तद् 'that,' the one is used in the ablative case only and the other in the locative. So also यतः, यत्र, तदा, यदा, सर्वदा &c.
