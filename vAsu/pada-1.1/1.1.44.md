vRtti_eng: '''May or may not'' is called _vibhasha_ or option.'

This _sutra _ defines the word विभाषा. We had already had occasion to use this word in _sutras_ (I.1.28) and (I.1.32). Where there is a prohibition as well as an alternative course left open, it is called option or _vibhasha_. The commentators mention three kinds of _vibhasha_:- _prapta_-_vibhasha_., _aprapta_-_vibhasha_ and _praptaprapta_-_vibhasha_. The first occurs where there is a general rule already given, and then follows the optional rule; the second belongs to that class where there is no such general rule, but there is an optional rule, the third is intermediate between the two.

Thus the root श्वि, 'to swell,' by virtue of the rule  विभाषा श्वे (V.1.30), forms its perfect tense, either by _samprasarana_, or in the ordinary way. Thus the third person singular is either शुशाव or शिश्वाय.
