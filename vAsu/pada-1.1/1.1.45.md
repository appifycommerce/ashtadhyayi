sutra: इग्यणः संप्रसारणम्
vRtti: इग्यो यणः स्थाने भूतो भावी वा तस्य संप्रसारणमित्येषा संज्ञा भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _ik_ vowels which replace the semi-vowels _yan_ are called _samprasarana_.

This defines the word _samprasarana_. It is the name given to the change of semi-vowels into vowels. The _pratyahara_ _ik_ includes the four simple vowels ई, उ, ऋ and लृ, and their corresponding semi-vowels are य्, व्, र्, and ल् included in the _pratyahara_ _yan_. The word _samprasarana_ is properly the name of the vowel which has replaced the semi-vowel. Thus the past participle of स्वप् 'to sleep,' is formed by adding the _nishtha_ affix क्त (see _sutra_ (I.1.26)). So that we have स्वप् + त. But there is a rule (VI.1.15) by which there is samprasarana of the व of स्वप् before the कित् affixes, and we have the form सुप्तः 'slept.' Similarly from वद् - उदितः, यज् - इष्टम्, व्यध् - विद्धः, ग्रह् – गृहीतम् – प्रछ्- पृष्टम्. The term _samprasarana_ is also employed to designate the whole process of the change of the semi-vowels into vowels as in (VI.1.13); (VI.4.131).
