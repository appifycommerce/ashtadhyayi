sutra: क्ङिति च
vRtti: क्ङिन्निमित्ते ये गुणवृद्धी प्राप्नुतस्ते न भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: And that, which otherwise would have caused _guna_ or _vriddhi_, does not do so, when it has an indicatory क् ग् or ङ्.

Thus the past participle terminations क्त and क्तवतु are _ardhadhatuka_ affixes, which would, by the general rule (VII.3.84), have caused _guna_, but as their indicatory letter क is इत्, the real terminations being, त and तवत्, they do not cause _guna_. Therefore, when these terminations are added to a root, the _ik_ of the root is not _gunated_. Thus with the root चि "to collect" we have चितः or चितवान्, श्रू, "to hear", श्रुतः, श्रुतवान्; भी; "to fear" भीतः, भीतवान्.

Similarly the terminations क्यप् केलिम, क्वसु कानच्, क्त्वा, क्तिन्, &c., are all कित् terminations 'the indicatory letters of all being क्,' the real affixes being य, एलिम्, वस् &c. &c. &c. Before these, the root is not _gunated_. Thus we have from भृ "to bear" भृत्व, from भिद् "to pierce" भिदेलिम.

The terms कित् &c., of this _sûtra_ are in the locative or seventh case. The force of this case termination here is that of निमित or cause, that is the _guna_ or _vriddhi_ which would otherwise have been caused, does not take place, if an affix is कित्, गित्, ङित्. Thus all _ardhadhâtuka_ and _sårvadhatuka_ affixes cause _gunation_ of the final _ik_ of the inflective base (VII.3.84.) Thus the _Sårvadhâtuka_ affix शप्(अ) in the following:-

भू+शप्+तिप् = भो+अ+ति = भवति "he is." Similarly _sårvadhatuka_ and _ardbadhâtuka_ affixes cause the _guna_ substitution of the short penultimate _ik_ of the inflective base (VII.3.85). Thus बुध्+शप्+तिप् = बोधति.

The general force of the locative case in an aphorism is to cause the operation directed, on the expression immediately preceding it (I.1.66). If the force of the locative case in the present _sūtra_ were also that as explained in (I.1.66), then the interpretation would be this:- An affix having an indicatory _k_, _g_ or _ṅ_, would not cause the _guna_ substitution of the vowel _ik_, immediately preceding it. The case of the penultimate short _ik_ will not be covered by it. Then though the rule may apply to चि+क्त=चितः "collected" it would not apply to भिद्+क्त; there would be nothing to bar the _guna_ substitution of the penultimate इ of भिद्. This however is prevented by explaining the locative as one of "occasion" and thus भिद्+क्त = भिन्नः "broken."

Similarly from the root जि we have a word जिष्णुः 'victorious', in which the affix ग्स्नु has an indicatory ग्. Thus जि+ग्स्नु = जिष्णुः "victorious" (III.2.139), so also स्थास्नुः "durable,"

Similarly the affix, अङ् is a ङित् affix, the real suffix being अ, the ङ् being merely indicatory. Therefore when अङ् is added to a root, there is no _gunation_ or _vriddhing_. Thus we have from विद् "to know" विदः.

Similarly by (I.2.4), all _sårvadhâtuka_ affixes that are not marked by an indicatory प्, are treated as ङित्. Thus the second person singular termination तस् is ङित्, and we have चिनुतः "they two collect," similarly चिन्वन्ति, "they collect", मृज्+क्त = मृष्टः "cleansed," मृजन्ति "they cleanse."

The phrase "when indicated by the term _ik_" is understood in this _sutra_. The prohibition, therefore, applies to _ik_ vowels only, and not to all vowels in general. Thus by (III.1.30), the root कम् "to desire" takes the affix णिङ्; of this affix the letters ण् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix is इ. The force of ण् is to cause _vriddhi_ (VII.2.116). The indicatory ङ् does not prevent such _vriddhi_, as the letter अ of कम् is not included in _ik_. Thus we have कामि+अते = कामे+अते = कामयते "he desires".

According to the wish of the author of the _Mahabhashya_, the verb मृज् optionally takes _vriddhi_, before _kit_ or _ṅit_ affixes beginning with a vowel. As परिमृजन्ति or परिमार्जन्ति "they rub." Here in this _sūtra_ there is prohibition of the _guna_ of the short penultimate _ik_ also.

The indicatory ङ् of the verbal tense affixes i.e., लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ्, लृङ् is an exception to this rule of ङित्. This is an inference deduced from (III.4.104) which declares "when the sense is that of benediction, then the augment यासुट् of लिङ् is as if it were distinguished by an indicatory क." There would have been no necessity of making यासुट् a कित्, if लिङ् were a ङित्, but the very fact of making यासुट् a कित् indicates by implication or is ज्ञापक that the final ङ of लिङ्, लङ् &c. does not make these tense affixes ङित्. Thus in लङ् or Imperfect tense we have अचिनवम् "he collected" (अचिनू+लङ् = अचिनु+अम् = अचिनो+अम् = अचिनवम्.)
