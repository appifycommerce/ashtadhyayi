When any operation is to be made in a word following another, such operation is to be made in the initial letter of such subsequent word. To give an illustration:- there is a rule (VI.3.97) by which it is declared: "In the place of अप् used after the words द्वि and अन्तर् and the particles called उपसर्ग there is ई." This rule may be stated in other words as:- 'In the place of अप् there is ई when अप् follows द्वि or अन्तर्.' Now it is clear that ई is not to replace all the letters of अप् but only one. By _sutra_ (I.1.52) that letter would have been the last letter of अप्, but this _sutra_ makes an exception, namely, where an operation is directed to be made in a word, simply by reason of its being placed after another word; such change is to be made in the beginning of such second word. Therefore, the ई replaces the अ of अप् and we have द्वि + अप् = द्वीपं (the final अ is added by (V.4.74)) 'an island,' आन्तरीपं 'promontory.' So also in the _sutra_ ईदासः (VII.2.83) 'long ई is the substitute of अन when the latter comes after the root आस्.' Thus आस् + अन = आस् + ईन = आसीनः. Here also the ई replaces the initial अ of अन.

How can we find when an operation is to be performed on a subsequent word? When the previous word is exhibited in the 5th or ablative case, see _sutra_ (I.1.67).
