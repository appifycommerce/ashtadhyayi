vRtti_eng: Not so, in rules relating to the finals of words, to the doubling of letters, to the affixing of _varach_, to the elision of _ya_, to accent, to homogeneous letters, to _anusvara_, to the lengthening of vowels, and to the substitution of _jas_ and _char_ letters.

This _sutra_ lays down an exception to the previous _sutra_, by which it was ruled that an _adesa_ which replaced a vowel becomes _sthanivat_ under certain conditions. This _sutra_ says that a vowel _adesa_ is not _sthanivat_ under the following circumtances.

1. पदान्तविधिः-- 'A rule relating to the last letter of a word.' Thus the अ of अस् is elided before the terminations of dual and plural numbers (VI. 4. III). Thus we have अस्ति 'he is,' स्तः 'they two are,' सन्ति 'they are.' Now in the technical phraseology of Sanskrit grammarians, the अ of स्तः and सन्ति is replaced by an _adesa_ called लोप्, the peculiarity of which is that the whole of it vanishes. So that before the word स्तः there is this _adesa_ existing, though it is in an invisible form. This invisible _adesa_ will be _sthanivat_, as it replaces a vowel, by reason of something that follows, i. e. the affixes तः and अन्ति being ङित् (I. 2. 4); and it will have all the powers of अ by the last _sutra_, in the absence of any rule to the contrary. Therefore, in the sentence कौ स्तः 'who two are' the final औ of कौ and the invisible अ of स्तः ought to coalesce by rules of _sandhi_ into आव (VI. 1. 78). But this incongruity is prevented by the present _sutra_, by which the change of औ into आव् is a पदान्त विधि or a rule relating to the finals of a word, therefore, we have कौ स्तः । So also in तानि सन्ति, rule (VI. 1. 77) is not applied.

2. द्विर्वचनविधिः 'a rule relating to the doubling of letters.' In the _sandhi_ of दधि + अत्र we have दध्यत्र. Here इ is changed into य्. If this य् were _sthanivat_ to इ, then the rule by which ध् could be doubled before य् would be inapplicable. But य् is not equivalent to इ, though its substitute; and we have the doubling of ध् and get the form दद्ध्यत्र. Therefore, in rules relating to the doubling of letters the _adesa_ is not equivalent to the _sthani_.

3. वरेविधिः 'a rule relating to the affix वरच्.' The affix वरच् is a _krit_ affix which is added to certain roots to form nouns of agency; thus from ईश् 'to rule' we have ईश्वरः 'ruler.' So from the intensive verb यायाय we have यायावरः 'a vagrant.' It is formed in this wise यायाय + वर (III. 2. 176) = यायाय् + ० + वर (VI. 4. 48). Here the अ of य has been dropped and replaced by _lopa_, on account of its being followed by the _ardhadhatuka_ affix वरच्. The next step is to drop the य् by rule (VI. 1. 66) which declares that the letters व् and य् are dropped before affixes beginning with any consonant except i. e., beginning with consonants of वल् _pratyahara_. Thus याया + ० + वर. Now there is a rule (VI. 4. 64) which declares that the final long आ of a base is dropped before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes having an initial vowel. Here therefore, if the _adesa_ '_lopa_,' which replaced the vowel अ, be considered as _sthanivat_, and be considered as an affix having a latent initial vowel, then the आ of याया requires to be dropped. But this _sutra_ prevents this and we have the form यायावर; as, अप्सु यायावरः प्रवपेत पिण्डान् ॥

4. यलोपविधिः 'a rule relating to the dropping of _ya_.' Thus there is a verb कण्डूय 'to scratch'. In forming an abstract noun from it, the affix ति (tech. क्तिच्) is added. Thus कण्डूय + ति = कण्डूय् + ० + ति, the अ of य being dropped by (VI. 4. 48). Now there is a rule (VI. 1. 66) already mentioned above which requires the elision of य् before consonantal affixes. Now if the _lopa_ substitute be considered as _sthanivat_ to अ, then the affix ति is not an affix having an initial consonant and the rule, which requires the dropping of य्, would not apply. The present _sutra_, however, provides for this, and we have the form कण्डूतिः 'scratching.'

5. स्वरविधिः 'a rule relating to accent.' There is a _sutra_ (VI. 1. 193) which says that when a word is formed by an affix that has an indicatory ल्, the vowel that immediately precedes such an affix has the _udatta_ accent. Now ण्वुल् is an affix that has an indicatory ल्, the real affix bein अक (VII. I. I.). It is an affix used in forming nouns of agency. Adding this affix to the desiderative verb चिकीर्ष 'desirous of doing' we have:-- चिकीर्ष + अक = चिकीर्ष् + ० + अक, the अ being dropped by (VI. 4. 48). Now if the zero be considered as _sthanivat_, then the accent must fall on this latent अ but it is not so. The accent falls on the ई of की; and we have चिकीर्षकः, so also जिहीर्षकः ॥

6. सवर्णविधिः 'a rule relating to the substitution of homogeneous letters.' To explain this, let us form the second person singular of the verb शिष् in the imperative mood. The affix हि is the sign of the second person imperative singular; and the verb शिष् belongs to the seventh-class of verbs called _Rudhadi_. This class of verbs take the _vikarana_ श्नम् (III. 1. 78) the श् and म् being indicatory the real affix is न. This न is inserted between the radical vowel and the final consonant (I. 1. 47). Therefore we have the following equation:- शिष् + श्नम् + हि = शि + न + ष् + हि = शि + न् + ० + ष् + हि. The अ of न is dropped by (VI. 4. III), which declares that the अ of श्नम् is dropped before those _sarvadhatuka_ terminations which are कित् or ङित्. By (I. 2. 4) all _sarvadhatuka_ terminations which have not got an indicatory प् are considered as ङित्. The affix हि therefore is a ङित् _sarvadhatuka_ affix, and by rule (III. 4. 87), हि is to be regarded as अपित्, not having an indicatory प्. The next stage is :-- शि + न् + ० + ष् + धि; the हि being changed into धि by rule (VI. 4. 101) which says that 'हि is changed into धि, when it follows a root which ends in a consonant of झल् _pratyahara_:' here ष् and ध् are changed by general rules of _sandhi_ into ड् and ढ् and we have शि + न् + ० + ड् + ढि (VIII. 4. 41). Then there is a rule (VIII. 3. 24), which says that in the body of a word the 'न् is changed into _anusvara_ when followed by a consonant of झल् _pratyahara_.' Therefore we have :-- शि + ० + ० + ड् + ढि. This is the form to which the present rule is applicable. Thus, there is a rule (VIII. 4. 58) which says that an _anusvara_ followed by a letter of यय् _pratyahara_ i.e., any consonant except ह्, श् ष् and स् is changed into a letter homogeneous or _savarna_ to the letter that follows. Therefore, if we regard zero as _sthanivat_ to the अ which it replaces, the _anusvara_ cannot be changed into ण् as homogeneous to ङ्. But it is not to be so regarded, and we have the form शि + ण् + ड् + ढि = शिण्ड्ढि or शिण्ढि; so also पिण्ढि.

7. अनुस्वारविधिः 'a rule relating to _anusvara_.' The above example will serve the purpose here:-- शि + न् + ० + ड् + ढि. This by the rule already mentioned (VIII. 3. 24), requires the न् to be changed into _anusvara_. Now if zero be considered as _sthanivat_, then न् is not followed by a letter of झल् _pratyahara_ , and cannot be changed into _anusvara_. However, the zero is not regarded as _sthanivat_, and we change the न् into _anusvara_. Other examples are शि + न् + ० + ष् + अन्ति = शिंषन्ति; so also पिंषन्ति ॥  

8. दीर्घविधिः 'a rule directing the substitution of long vowels for short vowels.' Let us form the Inst. sing. of the noun प्रतिदिवन्. The termination of the Inst. sing. is टा or आ. Therefore, we have प्रतिदिवन् + आ = प्रतिदिव् + ० + न् + आ. Here the अ has been elided by rule (VI. 4. 134), which teaches that words ending in अन् lose their अ before terminations technically called _Bha_. The termination of Inst. sing. is a _Bha_ termination by force of rule (I. 4. 18). The next rule that now comes into operation, is (VIII. 2. 77), which requires the lengthening of the short penultimate vowels, of the इक् _pratyahara_, of words that end in र् or व् and are followed by a consonant. Here दिव् is a root that ends in व्; and if the zero be considered as _sthanivat_, then this व् is not followed by a consonant, but by a latent vowel, and so the short इ of दिव् will not be lengthened. This rule, however, provides for such lengthening, and therefore we have :- प्रतिदिव् + ० + न् + आ = प्रतिदीव्ना ॥

9. जश्विधिः 'a rule requiring the substitution of soft unaspirate consonants, of _pratyahara_ जश्, in the place of hard consonants' In this case also the _adesa_ that takes the place of a vowel is not _sthanivat_.

Let us add the affix क्तिन् to the root अद् 'to eat,' compounded with the word स or समान. In Vedic literature अद् is replaced by घस्, (II. 4. 39); so we have, स + घस् + क्तिन् = स + घस् + ति = स + घ् + ० + स् + ति (VI. 4. 100) = स + घ् + ० + ० + ति (VIII. 2. 26) = स + घ् + ० + ० + धि (VIII. 2. 40).

It is at this stage, that rule (VIII. 4. 53) requires the घ् to be changed into ग्. This is a जश् rule, and teaches that in the place of letters of झल् class, the letters of जश् class are substituted, if followed by letters of झश् class. If the zero which was obtained by dropping the अ of घ, be considered as _sthanivat_, then the घ् is not followed by a consonant of झश् class, and cannot be changed into ग्. But it is not so. Therefore सघ् + ० + ० + धि = सग्धिः (_Yaj_. _Ved_. XVIII. 9). The various rules, by which first अ is omitted, and then स् is dropped, have been referred to in brackets, and will be explained in their proper places.

Similarly the word बब्धाम्, which is the Imperative (_lot_) 2nd per. dual of the root भस्, and is thus evolved. This root belongs to the _Juhutyadi_ class, and therefore, there is reduplication. Thus भस् + ताम् = भस् + भस् + ताम् = भ + भस् + ताम् = ब + भस् + ताम् = ब + भ् + ० + स् + ताम् (VI. 4. 100) = ब + भ्+ ० + ० + ताम् (VIII. 2. 26) = ब + भ् + ० + ० + धाम् (VIII. 2. 40) = ब + ब् + ० + ० + धाम् = बब्धाम् ॥ Here the change of भ् into ब् is by the application of (VIII. 4. 53), which is a _jas_ rule, and therefore, the zero is not _sthanivat_.

10. चर्विधिः 'a rule requiring the substitution of the letters of चर् _pratyahara_ instead of other consonants.' In the application of this rule, also the substitute that replaces a vowel is not _sthanivat_.

Let us form the 2nd pers. sing. perfect of the verb अद् 'to eat.' अद् is replaced by घस् (II. 4. 40) and अतुस् is the termination of the second person singular of _lit_ or perfect tense.  घस् + अतुस् = घस् + घस् + अतुस् (VI. 1. 8) = घ + घस् + अतुस् (VII. 4. 60) = ज + घस् + अतुस् (VIII. 4. 54) = ज + घ् + ० + स् + अतुस् (VI. 4. 98) = जघ् + ० + सतुस्.

At this stage comes the चर् rule in operation, which says that the letters of झल्  _pratyahara_ are replaced by those of चर् _pratyahara_, when followed by letters of खर् _pratyahara_. Here घ् is a letter of झल् class, and if zero is not _sthanivat_, it is followed by स् which is a letter of खर् class, and therefore घ् is required to be changed into क् of चर् class. By the present rule, zero is not _sthanivat_ and thus we have :- जक् + सतुस् = जक्षतुः (VIII. 3. 60).

Similarly अक्षन् the 3rd per. plural aorist of घस् is thus formed:- अ + घस् + च्लि + अन् = अ + घस् + अन् (II. 4. 80) = अ + घ् + ० + स् + अन् (VI. 4. 98). Here had the _lopa_ been _sthanivat_, rule (VIII. 4. 55) could not have applied. But it being a _char_ rule, the _lopa_ is not _sthanivat_. Therefore we have, अक्षन्.

When _lopa_ is the substitute of a vowel, it is not _sthanivat_, for the purposes of the application of the rules of accent, rules relating to the doubling of letters, and the rules relating to the elision of _ya_. In other places, with the exception of the above three; the _lopa_ substitute of a vowel is, and must be treated as _sthanivat_. Thus बहुखट्वकः, किर्योः, गिर्योः, वाय्वोः. In these cases the _lopa_-_adesa_ being _sthanivat_, the rules relating to accent, lengthening and the elision of _ya_, do not apply.
