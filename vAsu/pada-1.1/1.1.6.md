sutra: दीधीवेवीटाम्
vRtti: दीधीवेव्योरिटश्चये गुणवृद्धी प्राप्नुतस्ते न भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The _guna_ and _vriddhi_ substitutions, which would otherwise have presented themselves, do not however come, in the place of the vowels of _didhi_ 'to shine,' and _vevi_ 'to go,' and of the augment called इट्.

The roots दीधी and वेवी never take the _guna_ or _vriddhi_ substitutions under ordinary circumstances. Thus the affix ण्वुल् generally causes _vriddhi_ substitution when added to any root; and so the affix ल्युट् causes _guņa_. But these affixes when applied to the verbs _didhi_ and _vevi_, never cause _vřiddhi_ or _guna_ substitution. As आदीधी+ण्वुल् = आदीधी+अक (VII.1.1) = आदीध्वकः (VI.1.77). So also आदीधी+ल्युट् = आदीधी+अन (VII.1.1) = आदीध्वनम्. Similarly from वेवी we have आवेव्यनम् and आवेव्यकः. In the Vedas, however, these verbs take _guna_. Thus अदीधेत् (_Rig_ _Ved_. X.98.7), and अदीधयुः (_Rig_ _Ved_. V.40.5). These two verbs are confined generally to the Vedic literature, and the present rule therefore, seems to be an unnecessary prohibition; as they take _guna_ in spite of such prohibition.

Of the augment इट् the real affix is इ. In the general tenses, it is added to certain terminations beginning with consonants of the वल् class, i.e., all consonants except य (VII.2.35). Thus the future termination, first person, singular is स्यामि; this when added to the root चर् "to move" requires an intermediate इ, and thus we have the form चरिष्यामि, 'I shall walk.' This इ is never _gunated_ or _vriddhied_, though according to the general rule, coming before an _ardhadhâtuka_ termination, it ought to have been _gunated_.

The augment इट्, could under no circumstances have taken _vriddhi_, the prohibition therefore, is in the case of the _guna_ substitute of इट्.
