sutra: प्रत्ययस्य लुक्श्लुलुपः
vRtti: प्रत्ययादर्शनस्य लुक् श्लु लुप् इत्येताः संज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The disappearance of an affix when it is caused by the words _luk_, _slu_ or _lup_ are designated by those terms respectively.

---
When an affix is elided by using the term _luk_, that disappearance gets the appellation of _luk_, similarly when an affix is elided by using the terms _slu_ or _lup_, the disappearance gets the name of _slu_ or _lup_.

Thus in अद् + शप्लुक् + ति = अत्ति 'he eats.' Here the _vikarana_ शप् has been elided by using the word _luk_ (II.4.72). Similarly in जुहोति 'he invokes,' the _vikarana_ शप् is elided by the word _slu_ (II.4.75), so in वरणाः 'a city in the vicinity of weeds called _varana_.' Here the _Taddhita_ affix indicating vicinity has been elided by the word _lup_. (IV.2.82).

Why do we use the words "of the affix"? Without these words, the _sutra_ would have run thus:- "The disappearance is called _luk_, _slu_ or _lup_." So that the disappearance of a base would also be caused by the use of these terms. Thus in (II.4.70), there would have been '_luk_' of the bases _agastya_, and _kaundinya_; which however is not intended. In that _sutra_, the '_luk_' of the affixes is only intended. So also in _sutra_ (IV.3.168) there would have been the substitution of '_luk_' for the bases of the words.
