sutra: अचोऽन्त्यादि टि
vRtti: अचां संनिविष्टानां योऽन्त्योच् तदादि शब्दरूपं टिसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The final portion of a word, beginning with the last among the vowels in the word, is called टि."
---
This _sutra _ defines टि. It is that portion of a word which is included between the last letter and the nearest vowel. Thus in the word अग्निचित् the portion इत् is टि; so also in सामसुत् the portion उत्. The word टि occurs in _sutra _ (III. 4. 79).

The word अचः in the _sutra_ is in the genitive case, which has the force of _nirdharana_ or specification; and though it is in the singular number, it represents class name, meaning 'among the vowels.'
