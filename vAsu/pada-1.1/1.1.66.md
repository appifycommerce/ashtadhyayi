sutra: तस्मिन्निति निर्दिष्टे पूर्वस्य
vRtti: तस्मिन्निति सप्तम्यर्थनिर्देशे पूर्वस्यैव कार्यं भवति नोत्तरस्य ॥
vRtti_eng: When a term is exhibited in the seventh case in these _sutras_, the operation directed, is to be understood as affecting the state of what immediately precedes that which the term denotes.

This is a declaratory or interpreting _sutra_. When in a _sutra_, a word is used in the locative case, the operation ordained by that _sutra_ is to be performed on the word preceding it. Thus in the _sutra_ इको यणचि (6.1.77) the word अचि is in the locative case, which _sutra_, therefore, means that इ, उ, ऋ लृ followed by a vowel (अच्) are changed into य्, व्, र्, ल्, (यण्). The literal translation of the _sutra_ being:- 'Of इक् there is यण् in अच्.' The force of 'in' or the locative case being to induce changes in the letter preceding the vowel. Thus दधि + उदकम् = दध्युदकम्; So मध्विदम्, पचत्योदनम् ॥

The word _nirdishta_ (meaning 'exhibited') has been used in the _sutra_ to indicate immediateness. Thus in अग्निचित्, the इ of अग्नि the is not directly followed by the इ of चित्, there being the letter च् intervening, therefore, rule (6.1.77), does not apply here : and we have no _sandhi_.
