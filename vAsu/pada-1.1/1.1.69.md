sutra: अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः
vRtti: अण् गृह्यमाण उदिच्च सवर्णानां ग्राहको भवति स्वस्य च रूपस्य प्रत्ययं वर्जयित्वा ॥
vRtti_eng: The letters of the _pratyahara_ अण् i. e. the vowels and semi-vowels, and a term having उ for its indicatory letter, refer to their own form as well as to their homogeneous letters, except when they are used as _pratyayas_ or affixes.

The _pratyahara_ अण् in thus _sutra_ includes all the vowels and liquids. This is the only instance where अण् _pratyahara_ refers to the second ण् of लण्. The letters included in अण्, and the letters having an indicatory उ, refer to, and include their homogeneous letters also. Thus कु refers to all the five gutturals क, ख, ग, घ, ङ, similarly चु, टु, तु, and पु, as in _sutra_ (1. 3. 8). Similarly अ includes short, long and protracted अ. The words 'its own form' are understood in this _sutra_, being drawn from the previous _sutra_. Thus _sutra_ आद्गुणः (VI.1.87), 'when a vowel comes after अ, _guna_ is the single substitute for both.' Here though the rule mentions only short अ, we take the long आ also. Thus not only नर + ईशः = नरेशः; but महा + ईशः = महेशः । So also in _sutra_ अस्य च्वौ (VII.4.32), 'there is long ई in the room of अ when the affix '_chvi_' (V.4.50) follows.' Here long आ is also included; thus कृष्ण + करोति = कृष्णीकरोति, and खट्वा + करोति = खट्वीकरोति. So also in _sutra_ यस्येति च (VI.4.148). 'When long ई follows, there is elision of the इ or अ of the base,' the rule applies to the bases ending in long ई and आ also.

This rule of course does not apply to affixes. Thus _sutra_ (III.2.168), says, 'after words ending in the affix _san_, and the words _asansa_ and _bhiksha_, there is उ.' Here उ is an affix and therefore does not include long ऊ. Thus भिक्षुः 'a beggar.' So also in (IV.3.9), the short अ only is to be taken and not the long one.
