sutra: आदिरन्त्येन सहेता
vRtti: आदिरन्त्येनेत्संज्ञकेन सह गृह्यमाणस्तन्मध्यपतितानां वर्णानां ग्राहको भवति स्वस्य च रूपस्य ॥
vRtti_eng: An initial letter, with a final इत् letter as a final, is the name of itself and of the intervening letters.

This _sutra_ explains the mode of interpreting _pratyaharas_. Thus the _pratyahara_ अक् means those letters whose beginning is अ and whose final इत् is क्.

Why do we say with 'the final indicatory letter?' Because a _pratyahara_ like सुट् would be otherwise ambiguous. It might be doubted whether it is formed with the final ट् of औट् and refers to the first five case-affixes, or whether it is formed with the initial ट् of टा and therefore refers to the first seven case-affixes. The present _sutra_ clears up the doubt. A _pratyahara_ is formed with the final इत् and not with the initial इत्.
