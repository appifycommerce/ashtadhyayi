sutra: वृद्धिर्यस्याचामादिस्तद् वृद्धम्
vRtti: अर्चामध्ये यस्य वृद्धिसंज्ञक आदिभूतस्तच्छब्दरूपं वृद्धसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: That word, among the vowels of which the first is a _vriddhi_, is called _vriddham_.

---
This defines the word वृद्धम्. The _sutra_ consists of five words :- वृद्धिः 'the _vriddhi_ vowel;' यस्य 'whose,' अचाम् 'among the vowels,' आदिः 'is first;' तद् 'that; वृद्धम् 'is called _vriddham_.'

If a word consisting of many vowels, has a _vriddhi_ vowel coming first in the order of vowels, that word is called _vriddham_. Thus the words माला, शाला &c., have the first vowel आ a _vriddhi_ vowel, therefore, they are called _vriddham_.

The word _vriddham_ has been defined in order to make applicable to these peculiar words certain _taddhita_ affixes. Thus there is a rule (IV.2.114) by which the affix छ् is added to _vriddham_. Thus माला + छ् = मालीयः ॥

Why do we say "the first?" Because a word like सभासंनयनः, which is not a _vriddha_ word, will not admit of the affix छ्. Its corresponding derivative will be साभासंनयनः ॥

Vart:- A proper noun, though not coming under the above definition, may yet be regarded optionally as a _vriddham_. Thus देवदत्त + छ् = देवदत्तीया, or we may have दैवदत्ता.

Vart:- A compound ending in a _Gotra_ word, is regarded for the purposes of the addition of this affix, as if it was not compounded. Thus रौढि is a _Gotra_ word and also _vriddham_. Its compound घृतरौढि will be regarded as a _vriddham_ too, for the addition of the affix. As घृतरौढि + छ् = घृतरौढीयाः 'the students of _Ghritaraudhi_.' So also ओदनपाणिनीयाः, वृद्धाम्भीयाः वृद्धकाश्यपीयाः &c.

Vart:- Exception must be made in the case of जिह्वाकात्य and हरितकात्य । They do not take छ्. Thus जैह्वाकाता and हारितकाताः.
