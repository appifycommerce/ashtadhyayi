sutra: हलन्ताच्च
vRtti: इगन्तादिक्समीपाद्धलः परः सन् झलादिः किद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And after a root ending in a consonant, and preceded by a vowel of the _pratyahara_ _ik_, the affix _san_ beginning with a _jhal_ consonant, is like _kit_.

Thus from भिद् 'to pierce' we have बिभित्सति 'he wishes to break,' here the root भिद् contains the _ik_ vowel इ; it ends in a consonant द्; the affix सन् is directly added without taking an intermediate इ, and therefore it fulfils all the conditions of the _sutra_; and the vowel is not _gunated_.

If the final consonant of the verb is not preceded by a vowel of the _ik_ class, the affix सन् is not _kit_ after such a verb. As यज् + सन् + ते = यियक्षते 'wishes to sacrifice.' Had the affix सन् been here a _kit_ affix, there would have been _samprasarana_ by rule (VI. 1. 16) which declares that there is _samprasarana_ of the verbs वच्, स्वप्, and यज् &c., before _kit_ affixes. 

If the _san_ takes the intermediate इ and is then no longer a झलादि सन् it is not _kit_; and causes _gunation_ etcetera. As वृत् + इ + सन् = विवर्तिषते 'he desires to be.' Here there is _guna_ of _ri_.

Roots like दम्भ्, तृंह् &c., are governed by this rule, though they end in conjunct consonants, for the word हल् of the _sutra_ means _jati_ or class; thus दम्भ् + सन् + तिप् = दभ् + सति (VI. 4. 24), the _m_ being elided by treating सन् as कित्) = धीप्सति or धिप्सति (VII. 4. 56).
