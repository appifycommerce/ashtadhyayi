sutra: लिङ्सिचावात्मनेपदेषु
vRtti: इगन्तादिक्समीपाद्धलः परौ झलादी लिङ्सिचौ आत्मनेपदेषु परतः कितौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "After roots ending in a consonant, that adjoins a vowel of _ik_ _pratyahara_, the substitutes of _lin_ (III. 3. 161) and _sich_ (III. 1. 44) when they begin with a consonant of _jhal_ _pratyahara_, are _kit_, when the _atmanepada_ affixes follow."

The _sutra_ consists of two words लिङ्सिचौ and आत्मनेपदेषु, literally meaning "the affixes _lin_ and _sich_ in the _Atmanepada_." The other phrases, given in the above text must be supplied from the previous _sutras_, to complete the sense. The _anuvritti_ of the word सन्, that began with _sutra_ (I. 2. 8), does not extend further. As:- भित्सीष्ट 'may he break' and भुत्सीष्ट 'may he know,' अभित्त 'he broke', अबुद्ध 'he knew.'

Thus the root भिद् ends with a simple consonant, is preceded by इ a letter of _ik_ _pratyahara_ ; after this root the _jhaladi_ affix सीष्ट of Benedictive in the _Atmanepada_ is treated like कित्; therefore there is no _guna_ substitution of the vowel of the root before this affix. भिद् + सीष्ट = भित्सीष्ट. Similarly in the Aorist we have अभित्त = अ + भिद् + सिच् + त, the स of the Aorist being elided by (VIII. 2. 26). So also बुध् + सीष्ट = भुत् + सीष्ट (VIII. 2. 37) = भुत्सीष्ट.

If the final consonant is not preceded by an _ik_ vowel, this rule will not apply. Thus Ben. यज् + सीष्ट = यष् + सीष्ट (VIII. 2. 36) = यक् + सीष्ट (VIII. 2. 41) = यक्षीट (VIII. 3. 58). Similarly its Aorist is अयष्ट. Had the affixes सीष्ट and त been _kit_, they would have caused _samprasarana_ of य by (VI. 3. 16).

This rule will not apply, if the Benedictive and Aorist affixes are _Parasmaipadi_. Thus the Aorist of सृज् 'to let off,' is अ + सृज् + सीत् = अ + सृज् + अ + ज् + सीत् (VI. 1. 58) = अस्रज् + सीत् (VI. 1. 77) = अस्राक्षीत् (VII. 2. I). Similarly from दृश् we have Aorist _Parasmaipadi_ अद्राक्षीत्. Had the Aorist been कित्, rule (VI. 1. 58) (अम् is the augment of the verbs सृज् and दृश् when an affix beginning with a _jhal_ and not having an indicatory क् follows), would not have applied.

This rule will also not apply, if the verb ends in a vowel. Thus of the verb चि, we have Ben. चेषष्टि, Aor. अचेष्ट. Had the affixes been कित्, there would have been no _guna_ substitution of _i_ into _e_.

The rule will not apply, if these affixes are not _jhaladi_, but take the augment इट्. Thus Ben. वृत् + इषीष्ट = वर्तिषीष्ट, so also Aorist अवर्तिट. Had they been कित्, there would have been no _guna_ substitution.

This rule, of course, is confined to the Benedictive and the Aorist. Other tenses will not be affected by this rule. Thus the Ist and 2nd Future of द्विष् is द्वेष्टा and द्वेक्ष्यति.
