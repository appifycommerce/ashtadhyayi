sutra: हनः सिच्
vRtti: हन्तेर्धातोः परः सिच् किद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _sich_ _Atmanepada_ affixes are _kit_ after the root _han_ 'to kill.'

As आहत, आहसाताम्, आहसत are the aorist of हन्. When a सिच् or second aorist is _kit_ the verb loses its nasal, by Rule (VI.4.37). After the verb हन् the सिच् is only _kit_ and not the Benedictive लिङ् terminations, as was the case in the previous _sutra_; hence the repetition of the word _sich_ in this _sutra_. The _sutras_ (I.2.12) and (I.2.13) were governed both by लिङ् and सिच्; from and after this _sutra_, the governing power of लिङ् ceases. The governing power of the word "_Atmanepada_" in _sutra_ (I.2.11) does not however cease, and its _anuvritti_ runs through the succeeding _sutras_; though as regards this _sutra_, its _anuvritti_ is redundant, in as much as before the _Parasmaipada_ terminations, the root हन् is always replaced by वध् in the aorist, there is no necessity of making the affix _sich_ a _kit_. For the object served in making _sich_, _kit_, after the verb हन्, is to elide the nasal, while in the case of वध्, no such purpose can be served.
