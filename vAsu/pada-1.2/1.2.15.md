sutra: यमो गन्धने
vRtti: यमेर्धातोर्गन्धने वर्त्तमानात्परः सिच् प्रत्ययः कित् भवति आत्मनेपदेषु परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _sich_ before _Atmanepada_ affixes, is _kit_ after the verb _yam_, when meaning 'to divulge.'
---
The word _gandhana_ means 'to divulge,' 'to make known that which had been concealed.' The verb यम् has various meanings.

The result of _kit_ is that the nasal is elided. The verb यम् becomes _Atmanepada_ when preceded by the preposition आङ् by rule (1. 3. 28). Thus उत् + आ + यम् + त = उदायत = 'he divulged,' उदायसाताम्, उदायसत, the _sich_ is elided by (VIII. 2. 27) and म् by (VI. 4. 37). When the verb यम् has any other meaning than 'to divulge,' then the सिच् in the _Atmanepada_ is not _kit_; as उदायंस्त पादस् 'he raised the foot.' So also उदायंस्त कूपादुदकम् 'he raised water from the well.' Though here the verb _yam_ is in the transitive form and takes an object after it, yet it is _Atmanepadi_ by Rule (I. 3.75) which declares "after the verb _yam_ to strive, preceded by सम्, उत् and आङ् when it does not refer to a book, the _Atmanepada_ is employed."
