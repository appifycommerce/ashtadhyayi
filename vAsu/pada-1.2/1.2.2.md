sutra: विज इट्
vRtti: ओविजी भयचलनयोः अस्मात्पर इडादिः प्रत्ययो ङिद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "An affix that begins with the augment इट् (VII. 2. 35) is _nit_ after the root _vij_., 'to fear, to move.'"

The root विज् does not strengthen its vowel before the affixes that take the intermediate इ, because those terminations are treated like ङित् affixes. The root विज् belongs to the _Tudadi_ class. Thus उद्विजिता 'he will be agitated,' उद्विजितुम् 'for the purpose of being agitated,' उद्विजितव्यम् 'ought to be agitated.'

But those affixes, which are not preceded by the augment इट्, are not like ङित्, and they consequently produce their own proper action, such as _gunation_ &c. As उत् + विज् + ल्युट् = उद्वेजनम्, उद्वेजनीयम् 'that which ought to be agitated.'
