vRtti: उदुपधाद्धातोः परो भावे आदिकर्मणि च वर्त्तमानो निष्ठाप्रत्ययः सेडन्यतरस्यां न किद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _set_ _Nishtha_ is optionally not _kit_, after the verbs with a penultimate उ if used impersonally or denoting the beginning of action.

---
According to some the _set_ _Nishtha_ suffixes are not _kit_ after the verbs having a penultimate उ if those verbs are used impersonally (_bhava_) or denote the beginning of action (_adi_-_karman_). Thus द्युत् 'to shine', द्युतितमनेन or द्योतितमनेन 'it has been lighted.' Similarly प्रद्योतितः or प्रद्युतितः 'he first illumined.' The word penultimate or _upadha_ has been defined in _sutra_ (I.2.65) _ante_.

If the verb has any other vowel than उ as penultimate, then the rule does not apply. As लिखितमनेन 'written by him.' Here इ is penultimate; and therefore no option is allowed.

This rule has no application where the _Nishtha_ does not express either भाव 'condition' or 'Impersonal action'; or आदिकर्म 'if beginning of action', but is used as a verbal adjective. As रुचितं कार्षापाणं ददाति 'he gives a shining coin (called _karshapana_).' Here the word रुचित 'shining' is used as adjective.

The rule applies to the _Nishtha_ which takes the intermediate इ and not to others as प्रभुक्त ओदनः 'the rice that has been eaten.' Here no option is allowed.

This optional form of past participle is restricted in its scope. Those verbs which take the _vikarana_ शप् i.e., the verbs of the _Bhu_ class &c., admit of this option. Thus गुध् 'to wrap up' belongs to _Divadi_ class, and therefore, its participle has one form only as गुधितं.
