sutra: पूङः क्त्वा च
vRtti: पूङः परो निष्ठा प्रत्ययः क्त्वा च सेण्न किद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _set_ _Nishtha_ and the _set_ _ktva_ are not _kit_ after the verb _pun_ \"to purify.'

The word 'optionally' of the previous _sutra_ (I. 2. 21) does not govern this _sutra_, because the word 'optionally' has been again used in the next _sutra_ (I. 2. 23); of which there would have been no necessity had the word 'optionally' governing force in this _sutra_, for then this would have also governed the next _sutra_. The _anuvritti_ of न सेट् however is to be read in this _sutra_.

By rule (VII. 2. 51), after the verb पू the affixes _Nishtha_ and क्त्वा _ktva_ take the intermediate इ. So that क्त्वा _ktva_ being _set_ (by virtue of Rule (VII. 2. 51)) would have been non-_kit_ by Rule 18; and it might be asked what is the necessity of repeating it in this _sutra_, when _sutra_ (I. 2. 18) comprised the case. The reason of this repetition is that by mentioning क्त्वा _ktva_ in this _sutra_, it has governing force over the succeeding _sutras_. As पवितः, पवितवान्.
