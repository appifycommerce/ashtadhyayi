sutra: रलो व्युपधाद्धलादेः संश्च
vRtti: उकारोपधादिकारोपधाच्चधातो रलन्ताद्धलादेः परः संश्च क्त्वाच सेटौ वा कितौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: After a verb which begins with a consonant, and ends in a letter of _Ral_ _pratyahara_, and has as its penultimate इ or ई, उ or ऊ, the _ktva_ and _san_ affixes are optionally _kit_.

The wording of this _sutra_ requires a little explanation. It consists of the following words:-

1. रलः _ralah_, ablative of रल् (after the consonants included in the _Pratayahara_ _ral_ i.e., all the consonants except य् _y_ and व् _v_) :- Verbs having their final letter any single consonant except य् _y_ and व् _v_.

2. व्युपधात् and means "after penultimate वी." It is a compound of वी + उपधा. The वी itself is a compound of उ + इ = वि, in the dual वी. Therefore the phrase means "after (verbs) having for their penultimate either इ _i_ or उ _u_ long or short."

3. हलादेः means "beginning with a consonant."

All these three words qualify the word "verb" understood.

4. संश्च means "and _san_."

The _sutra_ means, those verbs which have a रल् letter in the end, a हल् in the beginning, and an इ, ई or उ, ऊ in their penultimate, may optionally treat the affixes _ktva_ and _san_ as कित्.

Thus दद्युत् 'to shine,' makes दद्युतित्वा or द्योतित्वा 'having shone,' लिख् 'to write' makes लिखित्वा or लेखित्वा.

Similarly in _san_ affix we have लिलिखिषति or लिलेखिषति 'he wishes to write', दिदद्युतिषते or दिद्योतिषते 'wishes to shine.'

The rule does not apply if the verb ends in a letter other than रल्. As दिव् + क्त्वा = देवित्वा; its desiderative will be दिदेविषति. No option is allowed here.

Similarly there is no option when the penultimate vowel is not इ or उ. As वृत्त् + क्त्वा = वर्तित्वा Des. विवर्तिषते.

The rule also does not apply if the verb does not begin with a consonant. As एषित्वा and एषिषिषति. There is no option allowed here.

The rule does not apply if the क्त्वा and सन् are _anit_. As भुक्त्वा, बुभुक्षते.

In these 26 _sutras_ the description of affixes which are treated like ङित् and कित् is comprised.
