sutra: ऊकालोऽज् हृस्वदीर्घप्लुतः
vRtti: उ ऊ ऊ३ इत्येवं कालोऽज् हृस्वदीर्घप्लुत इत्येवं संज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A vowel whose time is that of short _u_, long _u_ and the prolated _u_, is called respectively _hrasva_ short, _dirgha_ long, and _pluta_ prolated.

---
The उ _u_ having one _matra_ or measure is short, having two measures is long, having three measures is _pluta_. This _sutra_ defines the three kinds of vowels according to their _matra_. The letter ऊ _u_ has been taken to illustrate the rule. The phrase हृस्वदीर्घप्लुतः is a _Dvandva_ compound, in the Singular, and is exhibited in the masculine gender, contrary to the general rule (II.4.17).

The word _kala_ means measure of time required for pronouncing a vowel.

As दधि 'curd', मधु 'honey'. Here इ and उ are short. कुमारी, गौरी, here ई is long. देवदत्ता३ अन्वास _Devadatta_! Here आ _a_ is _pluta_ or prolated.

These words are used in the following _sutras_: (1. 2. 47); (VII.4.25); (VIII.2.82).
