sutra: अचश्च
vRtti: हृस्व दीर्घ प्लुताः स्वसंज्ञायाशिष्यमाणा अचएवस्थाने वेदितव्याः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The short, long, and prolated, when enunciated as such, by using these terms, are to be understood to come in the place of vowels only."

This is a _paribhasha_ _sutra_, and declares the object to which the terms 'short, 'long' and 'prolated' are to be applied. When in this book 'short' 'long' or 'prolated' are taught by using the words _hrasva_, _dirgha_ or _pluta_, they must be understood to apply to vowels. As will be found in the _sutra_ (1. 2. 47) \[1\] "there is the substitution of _hrasva_ or short in the neuter gender of the crude-form." The word 'vowel' must be inserted in this _sutra_ to complete the sense. That is:- the _hrasva_ is substituted for the final vowel of the crude-form. As रै अतिरि, नौ अतिनु, गा उपगु.

The substitution must take the place of vowel and not consonant. As सुवाग् ब्राह्मणकुलम्.

Similarly _sutra_ (VII. 4. 25) \[2\] teaches "There is the substitution of _dirgha_ or 'long vowel' before all affixes beginning with the letter य्, except _krit_ and _Sarvadhatuka_ affixes." Here also the word 'vowel' must be read into the _sutra_ which will then be "of an inflective base ending in a vowel, the long vowel shall be the substitute &c." As चि + यङ् + त = चीयते 'it is collected'; श्रु + य + त = श्रूयते 'it is heard.' Why do we say "in the place of vowels only"? The substitution must take place in the room of a vowel and not of a consonant. As भिद् + य + ते = भिद्यते 'it is divided,' छिद्यते 'it is pierced.'

So also in the case of _pluta_ substitution. Thus rules (VIII. 2. 82) and (VIII. 2. 84) \[3\], declare that in calling from a distance, _pluta_ is substituted for the टि portion of the word in the vocative. (The word टि is defined in (I. 1. 64)). Here also the phrase 'of the vowel' must be read into the _sutra_ to complete the sense. The _sutra_ will then read:- "_Pluta_ is substituted in the place of the vowel of the टि &c." Thus देवदत्त३, _O_ _Devadatta_! यज्ञदत्त३ _O_ _Yajnadatta_ !

Why do we say "in the place of vowels only"? The substitution must be in the place of the vowel of the टि and not of the consonant. As अग्निचि३त्, सोमसु३त्. Here the syllables इत् and उत् are टि, and the vowels इ and उ have been prolated and not the consonant त्.

The substitution must be enunciated as such by using the terms, _hrasva_, _dirgha_, and _pluta_. Therefore it is not so here; द्यौः, पन्थाः, सः, द्युभ्याम्, द्युभिः See (I. I. 4).
