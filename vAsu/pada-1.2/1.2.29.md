sutra: उच्चैरुदात्तः
vRtti: उच्चैरुपलभ्यमानो योअच् स उदात्तसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The vowel that is perceived as having a high tone is called _Udatta_ or acutely accented.

With this _sutra_ begins the description of the three sorts of vowel accents. The accent placed on a vowel by raising the voice is called _udatta_ or acute accent. As अग्निः _agnih_, here _i_ has the acute accent. The _udatta_ is not marked in writing. The word 'vowel' of the previous _sutra_ is understood in this also. These accents are the qualities of letters, and are well known in the sacred and secular literature. The vowel which is perceived as having a high tone is called _udatta_. This tone depends upon the organ from which the vowel is pronounced. In the various organs, such as the throat, palate, &c., if a vowel is pronounced from a higher part of that organ, it is called _udatta_. The vowel in the pronouncing of which there is the restraining and checking of the bodily parts, and in which there is dryness and roughness of tone as well as a contraction of the larynx, is said to have the acute accent. The word is used in _sutra_ (III. I. 3) \[1\] "The first vowel of an affix has the _udatta_ accent." As कृ + तव्यम् = कर्तव्यम् _kartavyam_.
