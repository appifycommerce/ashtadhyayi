sutra: समाहारः स्वरितः
vRtti: उदात्तानुदात्तस्वरसमाहारो योऽच् स स्वरितसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The vowel that has the combination of _Udatta_ and _Anudatta_ tones is said to be _svarita_ or circumflexly accented."
---
The word "vowel" of s. 28 is understood here also. The _svarita_ or circumflexed accent is pronounced by the combined raising and falling of the voice. It is marked by a perpendicular line on the top of the letter.
The word is used in _sutra_ (VI. I. 185) \[1\]. "The affixes having an indicatory त् _t_ have _svarita_ accent." As क॒॒न्या॑ _kanya_, शि॒॒क्य॑म् _sikyam_, क्व॑ _kva_.

This _sutra_ is not to be understood to mean that a _svarita_ is the resultant of the combination of two vowels, an _udatta_ vowel with an _anudatta_ vowel. It means the accent midway between the two well-known qualities of letters known as acute and grave accents.
