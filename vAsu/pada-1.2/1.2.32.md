sutra: तस्यादित उदात्तमर्द्धहृस्वम्
vRtti: तस्य स्वरितस्य आदावर्द्धहृस्वमुदात्तम् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Of it (_svarita_) the first portion is _udatta_, to the extent of a half measure, of prosodial length.

It has been defined that _svarita_ accent is a combination of _udatta_ and _anudatta_. It remained doubtful what portion was acute and what grave. The present _sutra_ clears up the difficulty, by declaring that in _svarita_, the first half is accute and the other grave.

The phrase _ardhahrasva_ is used to indicate half the measure of a short vowel. Thus if a short vowel is _svarita_, its _matra_ being one, half will be _udatta_ and the other half _anudatta_. If a long vowel, whose _matras_ are two, be _svarita_ then 1/2 will be _udatta_, 1 1/2 will be _anudatta_. If a _pluta_ (protracted) vowel be _svarita_, then first half measure will be _udatta_, and the remaining 2 1/2measures will be _anudatta_. In short, the _udatta_ portion of a _svarita_ must not occupy more time than is taken in pronouncing a half short vowel. Thus in शि॒क्य॑म् _sikyam_, the _a_ is _svarita_, half being acute, the other half grave or monotony; in क॒न्या॑ _kanya_, the long _a_ is _svarita_, its first half measure is acute, the remaining 1 1/2 is grave; in मानवका॑३ _manavaka_, here a prolated is _svarita_, its first 1/2 is acute, the balance 2 1/2 measure is grave.
