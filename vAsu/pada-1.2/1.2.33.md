sutra: एकश्रुतिदूरात्सम्बुद्धौ
vRtti: एकश्रुति वाक्यं भवति दूरात्सम्बुद्धौ सति ॥
vRtti_eng: In addressing a person from a distance, the tone is called _Ekasruti_ or monotony.

---
Monotony or _Ekasruti_ is that tone which is perceived when a person is addressed; in it there is an absence of all the three tones mentioned above; and there is no definite pitch in it. It is, therefore, the ordinary recitative tone.

The word '_Sambuddhi_' means here addressing a person from a distance; and has not its technical meaning of the singular number of the vocative case. As आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्ता३ '_O_ boy _Devadatta_! come.' There is vanishing of all the accents in the above case; and the final short vowel of _Devadatta_ is changed into _pluta_ by the rule already referred to in _sutra_ (I.2.28) _ante_ ((VIII.2.84) दूराद्धूतेच) ॥

If the person is not addressed from a distance, then the word will get its proper accent. As आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्त 'come, O boy _Devadatta_.'
