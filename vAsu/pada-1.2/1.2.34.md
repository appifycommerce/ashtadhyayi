In "sacrificial works" or on occasions of sacrifice, the _mantras_ of the _Veda_ are recited in _Ekasruti_ or monotony. But on occasions of ordinary reading, the _mantras_ are to be recited with their proper three-fold accents.

"_Japa_" is the repetition of _mantras_, and their recitation in a low voice or whisper. _Nyunkha_ is the name of certain hymns of the _veda_, and the names of 16 sorts of "_Om_." Some of these are pronounced with _udatta_ and others with _anudatta_ accent. _Samas_ are songs, or the musical cadence in which some vedic hymns are to be uttered. As:- अ॒॒ग्निर्मूद्धादि॒॒वः क॒॒कुत्पतिः॑ पृथि॒॒व्या अ॒॒यम् । अपाम् रेतांसि जिन्वतो३ म् (_Rig_ _Veda_ VIII. 14. 16).

When a _mantra_ is recited as a _japa_, then it must be pronounced with accents :- As समा॑ग्ने वर्चो॑ विह॒॒वेष्वं॑स्तु (_Rig_ _Veda_ X. 128. I).

When not employed on occasions of sacrifice, but are ordinarily read, the _mantras_ must have their proper accent, and there will be no _Ekasruti_.

In the _sama_ chanting, the _mantras_ should have their accent, there can be no _Ekasruti_ there. As ए३विस्वं समत्रिणं दहा३. Here there is no _Ekasruti_.
