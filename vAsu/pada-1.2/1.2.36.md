sutra: विभाषा छन्दसि
vRtti: छन्दसि विषये विभाषा एक श्रुतिर्भवति पक्षान्तरे त्रैस्वर्यमेव भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The Monotony is optional in the recitation of the Vedas, or they may be recited with accents."
---
In the _Chhandas_ or the Vedas there is option either to use the _Ekasruti_ tone or the three tones. Even on the occasion of ordinary reading, the _Chhandas_ might be uttered either with the three accents or monotonously. Some say this is a limited option (_vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_).

The option allowed by this _sutra_ is to be adjusted in this way. In reading the _Mantra_ portion of the _Veda_, every word must be pronounced with its proper accent: but in the _Brahmana_ portion of the _Veda_ there might be _Ekasruti_; while some say there must be _Ekasruti_ necessarily and not optionally in the recitation of the _Brahmanas_.

Thus:- अ॒॒ग्निमी॑ले पु॒॒रोहि॑तं or simply अग्निमीले पुरोहितं. "I praise _Agni_ the _purohita_."

The word वा "optionally" of the last _sutra_ could easily have been read into this _sutra_ by the rule of _anuvritti_; why then use the word विभाषा "optional" again ? To this we reply, this apparently redundant repetition is for the sake of indicating that the _anuvritti_ of the word यज्ञकर्मणि, which was understood in the last _sutra_, does not extend to this. Had we taken the _anuvritti_ of वा, the other word also would have been attracted; hence the separate use of the word विभाषा.
