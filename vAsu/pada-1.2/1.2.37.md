sutra: न सुब्रह्मण्यायां स्वरितस्य तूदात्तः
vRtti: सुब्रह्मण्यायामेकश्रुतिर्नभवति । यस्तु लक्षणप्राप्तः स्वरितस्तस्योदात्त आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "There should be no Monotony in the recitation of the _Subrahmanya_ hymns and in those hymns, the vowels, that would otherwise have taken the _svarita_ accent, take the _udatta_ accent instead."

The _subrahmanya_ hymns are portions of the _Rig_ _Veda_ mentioned in the _satapatha_ _Brahmana_.

This _sutra_ prohibits _Ekasruti_ in the case of certain prayers called _subrahmanya_. By rule (I. 2. 34) read with (I. 2. 36) _ante_, prayers might be optionally uttered with _Ekasruti_ accent. This ordains an exception to that rule In _subrahmanya_ prayers there is no _ekasruti_; and in these hymns, a vowel which otherwise by any rule of grammar would have taken a _svarita_ accent, takes an _udatta_ accent instead.

As स॒॒ब्रह्म॒॒ण्यो३ मिन्द्रागच्छ॒॒ हरिव॒॒ आगच्छ॒॒. Here the word सुब्रह्मण्य is formed by the addition of the affix यत् to the word सुब्रह्मण्, and this य will get _svarita_ accent by (VI. 1. 185), (तित्स्वरितम्) as it has an indicatory त्; by the present _sutra_, this nascent _svarita_ is changed into _udatta_. In the phrase इन्द्र आगच्छ, the word _Indra_ being in the vocative case, इ is _udatta_, the अ of _Indra_ is _anudatta_ (VI. 1. 198) \[1\]. The _anudatta_ preceded by an _udatta_ is changed into _svarita_ (VIII. 4. 66) \[2\].

Thus the अ of इन्द्र must become _svarita_, but by the present _sutra_ this nascent _svarita_ is changed into an _uddatta_. Thus in इन्द्र, both vowels become _udatta_. In the word आगच्छ, the आ is _udatta_; the next letter which was _anudatta_ becomes _svarita_, and from _svarita_ it is changed to _udatta_ by the present rule. Thus in the sentence इन्द्र आगच्छ the first four syllables are all acutely accented, the fifth syllable is only _anudatta_. So also in हरिव आगच्छ, for the reasons given above, the letters व and च्छ are _anudatta_, the rest are all acutely accented.
