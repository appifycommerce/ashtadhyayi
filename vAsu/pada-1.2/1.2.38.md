sutra: देवब्रह्मणोरनुदात्तः
vRtti: देवब्रह्मणोः स्वरितस्यानु दात्त आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _deva_ and _Brahmana_ in those hymns have _anudatta_ accent.

By _sutra_ (I. 2. 37), it was declared, that in _subrahmanya_ hymns, _svarita_ accent is replaced by _udatta_ accent. This _sutra_ makes an exception in favour of the words देव and ब्राह्मण occurring in those hymns. These words have _anudatta_ accent. As देवा॒ ब्रह्मा॒ण आग॒च्छत 'come ye _Devas_ and _Brahmanas_.' Here the word देवा gets _udatta_ accent on the first syllable by rule (VI. 1. 198) \[1\]. (in the vocative the accent is on the beginning): at वा _va_ has originally an _anudatta_ accent which by rule (VIII. 4. 66) \[2\] (an _anudatta_ following an _udatta_ is changed into _svarita_) would have been changed into _svarita_. This _svarita_, by the previous _sutra_ required to be changed into _udatta_; but by this rule, it is replaced by _anudatta_. In other words, the original _anudatta_ remains unchanged.
