sutra: स्वरितात्संहितायामनुदात्तानाम्
vRtti: संहितायाम् विषये स्वरितात्परेषामनुदात्तानामेकश्रुतिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The Monotony takes the place of the _anudatta_ vowels which follow the _svarita_ vowels, in close proximity (_sanhita_).

---
_Sanhita_ is the joining of two or more words in a sentence, for the purposes of reading or reciting. When words are thus glued together, then the _anudatta_ accents become _Ekasruti_ if they are preceded by _svarita_ vowels; and are pronounced monotonously. As इमं मे॑ गङ्गे यमुने सरस्वती (_Rig_ _Veda_ X. 75. 5) _O_ _Ganga_, _Yamuna_, _Sarasvsti_ ! this mine.

Here the word इमं has _udatta_ on the last syallable: the word मे is originally _anudatta_, but by rule (8.4.66) \[1\] following an _udatta_, it is changed into _svarita_; after this _svarita_ all _anudatta_ like गङ्गे, &c., are replaced by _ekasruti_. All the vowels of the words गङ्गे, यमुने &c, had _anudatta_ accent by rule (8.1.19) \[2\] (all vocatives get _anudatta_ if standing in the middle of a sentence and not beginning a stanza.)

The word "_sanhita_" has been used in the _sutra_ to show that when there is a hiatus between the words then there is no change of _anudatta_ into _ekasruti_. The word _sanhita_ will be defined in _sutra_ (1.4.109) \[3\].
