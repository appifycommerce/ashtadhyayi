sutra: उदात्तस्वरितपरस्य सन्नतरः
vRtti: उदात्तपरस्य स्वरितपरस्य चानुदात्तस्य सन्नतरआदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The accent called _Sannatara_ is substituted in the room of an _anudatta_ vowel, which has an _udatta_ or _svarita_ vowel following it.
---
In the previous _sutra_ it was said that an _anudatta_ preceded by a _svarita_ becomes _Ekasruti_. If, however, such an _anudatta_ is followed by an _udatta_ or a _svarita_, it does not become _Ekasruti_ but becomes _sannatara_, i.e. lower than _anudatta_.

The _sannatara_ is therefore that accent which was originally _anudatta_, and which is preceded by a _svarita_ and is followed by an _udatta_ or a _svarita_. 

This is one explanation of the _sutra_. There is another explanation which does not take the _anuvritti_ of _Ekasruti_ in this _sutra_. The _anudatta_ is replaced by _sannatara_ when such _anudatta_ immediately precedes an _udatta_ or a _svarita_. The _sannatara_ is also called _anudatta_. As देवा मरुतः पृश्निमातरोपः ॥

Here the word मातरः is _anudatta_. The word अपः has _udatta_ on the last syllable by (VI. 1. 171) \[1\]. In the phrase मातरोपः (मातरः + अपः) the syllable रो is _anudatta_, because _anudatta_ + _anudatta_ = _anudatta_. This _anudatta_ ओ, preceding the _udatta_ पः, is changed into _sannatara_.
