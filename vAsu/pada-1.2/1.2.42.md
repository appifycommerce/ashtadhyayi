sutra: तत्पुरुषः समानाधिकरणः कर्मधारयः
vRtti: तत्पुरुषः समानाधिकरणपदः कर्मधारयसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A _Tat_-_purusha_ compound, the case of each member of which is the same, is called _karmadharaya_ or Appositional Determinative compound.

"_Karmadharaya_ or Appositional Determinative compounds form a sub-division of the determinative compounds (_Tat_-_purusha_). In them the first portion stands as the predicate of the second portion, such as in black-beetle, sky-blue." (Max Muller).

The compounds like नीलोत्पलं 'the blue lotus', परमात्मा 'the supreme spirit' &c., are examples of _karmadharaya_ compounds. "The component words, if dissolved, would stand in the same case, (_samanadhikarana_), whereas in other _Tat_-_purushas_, the preceding word is governed by the last."

As, परमराज्यम्, is a _karmadharaya_ compound meaning "the best Government." Had it not been a _karmadharaya_ compound, the _udatta_ accent would have fallen on the syllable रा by rule (VI. 2. 130) \[1\] ,(the word राज्यम् has _udatta_ on the first syllable in _Tat_-_purusha_ compounds, except in _karmadharaya_).

Similarly पाचिका + वृन्दारिका = पाचकवृन्दारिका ((VI. 3. 42) \[2\] ,the feminine adjective is changed into masculine in the _karmadharaya_).

Each member of a compound may have the same case, but if it is not a _Tat_-_purusha_ compound, it won't be _karmadharaya_. As पाचिका + भार्या = पाचिकाभार्याः. 'He who has a wife for a cook.' This is an example of a _Bahuvrihi_ compound, and therefore the word पचिका retains its gender sign.

A compound may be a _Tat_-_purusha_, but if its component parts do not refer to the same thing and are not in the same case, it won't be _karmadharaya_:- ब्रा॒ह्म॒ण॒ राज्य॑म् _Brahmana_ _rajyam_, 'a _Brahmana_ kingdom.' Here राज्यम् gets _udatta_ on the first syllable by the rule already mentioned (VI. 2. 130).
