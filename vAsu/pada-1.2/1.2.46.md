sutra: कृत्तद्धितसमासाश्च
vRtti: कृतस्तद्धिताः समासाश्च प्रातिपदिकसंज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The forms ending in _Krit_ affixes, or _Taddhita_ affixes, or compound are also called _Pratipadika_.

This further explains the use of the word _pratipadika_. "Suffixes for the formation of nouns are of two kinds. Those by which nouns are derived direct from roots, primary suffixes. Those by which nouns are derived from other nouns, secondary suffixes. The former are called _Krit_, (III.1.93) \[1\], the latter _Taddhita_ (IV.1.76) \[2\]. Thus जन _jana_, man, is derived from the root जन् _jan_ by the _krit_ suffix अ; but जनीन _janina_, appropriate for man, is derived from जन _jana_ by the _Taddhita_ affix ईन _ina_. The name _pratipadika_ would apply both to जन _jana_ and जनीन _janina_, as nominal bases ready to receive the terminations of declension" (Max Muller).

Of the compounds, of which there are six varieties, we had occasion to refer to five already, viz. _Tat_-_purusha_, _Karmadharaya_, _Dvandva_, _Bahuvrihi_ and _Avyayibhava_. They will be fully dealt with in their proper places.
 
In the last _sutra_, the words "not ending in an affix" were too extensive; this _sutra_ makes an important provision in favour of words ending in _Krit_ or _Taddhita_ affixes. So also compounds are also called _pratipadika_. Being restricted to compounds only, it, of course, does not apply to sentences.

The words formed by _krit_ affixes are _pratipadika_, as कृ (to do) + ण्वुल् = कृ + वु = कार् + अक = कारक. The affix ण्वुल् is a _krit_ affix, and it is added to the root to form agent by Rule (III.1.133) \[3\]. The letters ण् and ल् are indicatory, the force of ण् being to cause the _vridhi_ of the vowel of the root. The real affix वु is changed into अक by (VII.1.1) \[4\]. the affixes यु and वु are replaced by अन and अक respectively. Thus the form कारक is a _pratipadika_, and is capable of declension by receiving case terminations, as कारकः ॥ Similarly कृ + तृच् (III.1.133) \[5\] = कर्तृ; nom. case कर्ता.

The word formed by _Taddhita_ affixes are also _pratipadika_; उपगु + अण् = औपगो + अ = औपगव 'the son of the _Rishi_ _Upagu_': nom. case औपगवः. Similarly कापटवः.

In fact in the chapters treating of these affixes, the derivative substantives formed by them are always shown by the Indian Grammarians in the nominative case singular number. The examples of nouns given in this book will be always declined nouns and not _pratipadikas_, except in peculiar cases. So also in the chapter of _samasa_ or compounds.

The words ending in compound are _pratipadika_: as राज्ञः + पुरुषः = राजपुरुषः, nom. case राजपुरुषः.
