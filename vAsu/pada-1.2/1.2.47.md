sutra: हृस्वो नपुंसके प्रातिपदिकस्यः
vRtti: नपुंसकलिङ्गेऽर्थे यत्प्रातिपदिकं वर्त्तते तस्य हृस्वो भवति आदेशोलोन्त्यस्याचः ॥
vRtti_eng: The short vowel is substituted in the neuter, for the final vowel, of a _pratipadika_.

---
In the neuter gender, the _pratipadika_ that would have ended in a long vowel, changes it into short. Thus अति + रै = अतिरि 'extravagant', as अतिरि = कुलम् 'an extravagant family'; अति लो = अतिलु 'very hairy', अतिलुं कुलं 'a very hairy family.'

There is no substitution of short vowel, if the noun is not in the neuter gender, as ग्राम + नी = ग्रामणी, nom case ग्रामणीः 'the leader of a village or head-borough.' Similarly सेनानीः 'the leader of an army.'

A word may be in the neuter gender, but if it is not a _pratipadika_, the vowel is not shortened. As काण्डे तिष्ठतः 'two cantos remain.' Here the ए of काण्डे is formed by the coalescence of अ (of the _pratipadika_ काण्ड) and इ (the dual case termination); thus काण्ड + इ = काण्डे. Now it might be urged that here one letter ए replaces two letters अ and इ. Therefore this substitute is equivalent to each of those letters separately, and consequently ए is the vowel of the _pratipadika_ and ought to be shortened. But this is not to be so, because the word _pratipadika_ has been especially mentioned in the text, and therefore this _ekadesa_ is not treated as the final of the form which precedes it.
