sutra: गोस्त्रियोरुपसर्जनस्य
vRtti: उपसर्जनगोशब्दान्तस्य उपसर्जनस्त्रीप्रत्ययान्तस्य च प्रातिपदिकस्य हृस्वो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "A short vowel is the substitute of _pratipadika_ which ends with the word गो 'a cow,' and of that which ends with what has as its termination a feminine affix; when regarded as _upasarjana_."
---
The word _upasarjana_ has been defined in _sutra_ (I. 2. 43). In compounds the word गो becomes shortened when it stands last and is an _upasarjana_.

Thus चित्र + गो = चित्रगुः 'possessed of a brindled cow.' This is an example of a _Bahuvrihi_ or possessive compound. So also शबलगु 'a spotted cow.' Similarly in those _pratipadika_ _upasarjanas_ which end in feminine suffixes having a final long vowel, there is a shortening. Thus निः + कौशाम्बी = निष्कौशाम्बिः. Here the final long ई is shortened. So also निर्वाराणसिः.

The word _pratipadika_ of the previous _sutra_ is understood in this. The word गो in the _sutra_ means the form गो and not other words synonym with it. The word स्त्री means "a word ending in a feminine affix," because it has the _svarita_ accent. The word _upasarjana_ qualifies both these words, i. e. when गो is an _upasarjana_ and when a word having a feminine termination is an _upasarjana_.

Other examples are:- अति + खट्वा = अतिखट्वः 'without a bed-stead' अतिमालः 'surpassing a necklace in beauty.'

If such a word is not an _upasarjana_, there is no shortening, as, राजकुमारी 'the king's daughter.' Here the word राजन् is _upasarjana_, and not the word कुमारी which latter is therefore not shortened. The word must be a derivative word formed by the addition of an affix, which makes it feminine. Thus the words लक्ष्मी, श्री &c. are feminine originally, and are not derived from the masculine nouns, by the addition of any feminine affix. Therefore we have अतिलक्ष्मी: 'surpassing _Lakshmi_ in beauty', अतिश्रीः ॥

Vart :- In _Bahuvrihi_ compounds, exception must be made of feminine nouns ending in the affix ईयसी, as बहुश्रेयसी, विद्यमानश्रेयसी ।
