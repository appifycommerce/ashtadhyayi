sutra: लुक्तद्धितलुकि
vRtti: तद्धितलुकि सति स्त्रीप्रत्ययस्य उपसर्जनस्य लुग्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "When a _Taddhita_ affix is elided by the word _luk_, there takes place the elision by _luk_ of the feminine affix of the _upasarjana_."
---
The word लुक् defined in _sutra_ 61, Chapter I, is twice used in this _sutra_. Where a _Taddhita_ affix is elided by the word लुक्, there the feminine suffix of the _pratipadika_ is also dropped, or becomes _luk_. Thus there are certain _Taddhita_ suffixes by which patronymics are formed (one of them being अण्) from other nouns. Before this अण् the initial vowel of the word is _vriddhied_ and the final is _gunated_. Thus सिन्धु 'ocean', forms सिन्धु + अण् = सैन्धो + अ = सैन्धव 'born in ocean or oceanic.' But there are certain words, e. g. श्रविष्ठा, फल्गुणी &c., which are all feminine gender (see _sutra_ (IV. 3. 34) \[1\] after which the patronymic suffix is totally elided, without leaving any trace of its action, by using the word _luk_. Thus श्रविष्ठा + (अण्लुक्) = श्राविश्ठः ॥ Here then the present _sutra_ finds its scope. The _Taddhita_ suffix being _luked_; the original feminine termination आ also becomes _luk_. Therefore the 'patronymic derivative of श्रविष्ठा (is not a longer word, as might have been expected) but actually a shorter word, namely श्रविष्ठः; similarly from फल्गुनी if we have फल्गुनः &c.

Thus there is a feminine suffix called ङीष् (actually ई) and certain words like इन्द्र &c., (IV. 1. 49) \[2\] take an additional suffix called आनुक् (actually आन्). Thus the feminine of इन्द्र will be इन्द्र + आनुक् + ङीष् = इन्द्र + आन् + ई = इन्द्राणी. Now in forming _Dvigu_ compound (Numeral Determinative compound), the _Taddhita_ suffixes are dropped. Thus पंचकपालः 'an offering (_purodash_) made in a dish with five compartments.' In this compound the _Taddhita_ suffix अण् is dropped. Otherwise the form would have been कापालः ॥ Similarly when the word इन्द्राणी forms a _Dvigu_ compound, the _Taddhita_ suffixes are dropped. But not only that, even the original radical affixes are also dropped by force of the present _sutra_. Thus पंचेन्द्रः which means the cake sacred to the five goddesses इन्द्राणी. Here the full form was पंच + इन्द्राणी + अण्. (The suffix अण् has the force of "sacred to God." Thus इन्द्र + अण् = ऐन्द्रं To sacred to God _Indra_). In the above expression, first the _Taddhita_ suffix अण् is _luked_ by rule contained in _sutra_ (IV. 1. 88) \[3\] relating to _Dvigu_ compounds: we have the remaining पंच + इन्द्राणी. In this stage, the present _sutra_ comes into force and declares that where a _Taddhita_ suffix has been _luked_, the final feminine suffixes of the _upasarjana_ _pratipadika_ are also _luked_. Therefore, the feminine suffixes आनुक् and ङीष् are also dropped, and we have पंचेन्द्रः which means "cake sacred to the five _Indranis_ (goddesses)."

The word स्त्री and _upasarjana_ of the last _sutra_ are understood in this. By the last _sutra_, a word ending in a feminine affix was told to be shortened when it was an _upasarjana_; this _sutra_ teaches the total suppression of such an affix in special cases. To take another example: Thus Rule (IV. 3. 163) declares फलेलुक् "_luk_ takes the place of an affix signifying modification or product when fruit is meant." Thus यत् is an affix which means modification. Thus गो + यत् = गव्यम् 'cow's milk or the product of cow.' This affix is suppressed when applied to a tree, in the sense of the fruit of the tree. Thus the fruit of the tree आमलकी will be called आमलकं, i. e. first the _Taddhita_ affix is _luked_, and then the feminine affix is also dropped. Similarly fruits of वदरी or बकुली trees are बदरं or बकुलं.

This rule only applies when a _Taddhita_ affix is elided; and not so when any other affix is _luked_. Thus गार्ग्याः + कुलं = गार्गीकुलम् 'the family of _Gargi_.' Here in forming the _samasa_, the case affix of the word _gargi_ is _luked_ by (II. 4. 71) \[3\]. But this suppression of the genitive termination does not necessitate the elision of the feminine affix ई of _gargi_.

This rule would not also apply if there is no elision by _luk_ of a _Taddhita_ affix, as in गार्गीत्वम्.

Nor will the rule apply when the word is not an _upasarjana_. As अवन्ती, कुन्ती, कुरूः.
