sutra: ईद् गोण्याः
vRtti: गोण्यास्तद्धितलुकि सति इकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The short is substituted in the place of _goni_, when _Taddhita_ affix is elided by _luk_.
---
By the former _sutra_ when a _Taddhita_ is elided, the long ई of the feminine also required elision. But this rule makes an exception in favor of the word गोणी३ in which, under similar circumstances the short इ replaces the long ई, as in the compound पंचगोणिः  'purchased for five _gonis_.' Here the _Taddhita_ suffix which conveys the meaning of "purchased for," has been rejected after गोणी by (V. 1 28) \[1\]. Therefore by previous _sutra_, the feminine suffix  ई also required rejection. But this _sutra_ intervenes and changes the long ई into short इ.

This _sutra_ is divided into two separate rules by the process called _yoga_-_vibhaga_. Thus इत् is made one _sutra_ by itself, and then it means, when there is a suppression of _Taddhita_ aflix by लुक्, then the long ई is replaced by short इ. Thus purchased with five needles पंचभिः सूचीभिः क्रीतः = पंचसूचिः, दशसूचिः. This is restricted to such examples of purchase only.
