The words of this _sutra_ require some detailed explanation. The name of a _jati_ or species, always denotes one, since it is a collective noun, and will naturally take the singular number; by the present _sutra_ such words may take the plural number also. In such nouns of class, the plural number has also the force of the singular. The _anuvritti_ of _asishyam_ does not go further.

It follows from this that adjectives which are not themselves common noun, such as संपन्नः &c., agree with the noun and will also get the plural number. Thus संपन्नो यवः or संपन्ना यवाः; "Full grown barley" पूर्ववया ब्राह्मणः प्रत्युत्येयः or पूर्ववयसो ब्राह्मणाः प्रत्युत्येयाः ॥ Why have we used the word _jati_ in this _sutra_ ? For this aphorism does not apply to Proper Nouns. Thus देवदत्तः _Devadatta_, यज्ञदत्तः _Yajnadatta_.

Why have we used the word आख्यायाम्? A word may be a class noun or _jati_, but it may not be the appellation of a class. Thus the statue of _Kasyapa_ may also be called _kasyapa_; this is a class noun; but as it is not the appellation आख्या or name of a class, such words cannot take the plural form and still denote a singular sense.

Why do we say '_ekasmin_'? When two or more class names are compounded as ब्रीहियवौ 'the rice and barley': the rule does not apply.

Vart:- An exception must be made when a class noun is qualified by a numeral adjective. As एको ब्रीहिः संपन्नः सुभिक्षं करोति.
