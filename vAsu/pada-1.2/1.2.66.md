sutra: स्त्री पुंवच्च
vRtti: स्त्री वृद्धा यूना सहवचने शिष्यते तल्लक्षणश्चेदेव विशेषो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And so also a feminine word, ending with a _vriddha_ affix, when similarly spoken along with the same word but which ends with a _yuvan_ affix, is only retained; and it is treated like a masculine.

When a word denoting _gotra_ and in the feminine gender is compounded with another word denoting a _yuvan_, the first is retained and the last is dropped; and the feminine noun so remaining is then treated like the masculine. This aphorism makes an addition to the previous _sutra_ and is governed by all the conditions mentioned in that _sutra_. Thus गर्गी + गार्ग्यायणः = गार्ग्यौ. Here note that the resultant form is the same as in the former _sutra_, namely the masculine.

Similarly दाक्षी + दाक्षायणः = दाक्षी (masculine dual of दाक्षि).

Vart:- The word _stri_ in the _sutra_ means _Vriddha_ _stri_, that is the eldest daughter of a grandson, or a further descendant considered as the female head of the family. The words '_tal_ _lakshanas_ _chedeva_ _viseshah_' of the previous _sutra_ govern this _sutra_ also, i.e. the distinction between the two words must be in their formative element and not in any thing else.
