With this _sutra_ ceases the governing force of the remaining conditions contained in _sutra_ (I. 2. 65). Even where the radical elements of two words are different there may be an _ekasesha_ under special circumstances. Thus भ्रातृ + स्वसृ = भ्रातरौ (brother and sister or brothers). Similarly पुत्र + दुहितृ = पुत्रौ, (son and daughter or sons).

N. B.- The practical application of this _sutra_ is very neatly illustrated by the following example. There is a verse in _Yajyanvalkya_ _smriti_ पत्नी दुहितरश्श्चैव पितरौ भ्रातरस्तथा which declares that on the death of a sonless person his property passes to his wife, daughters, parents and _bhratarah_.

Here the word _bhratarah_, if it be taken as simply the plural of _bhratri_, it means "brothers" and excludes sisters. But if it be interpreted according to this _sutra_, it means "brothers and sisters"; and thus gives sisters a right to inherit property of their brothers.
