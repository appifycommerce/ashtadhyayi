sutra: नपुंसकमनपुंसकेनैवच्चास्यान्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: नपुंसकानपुंसकमात्रकृते विशेषेऽनपुंसकेन सहवचने नपुंसकशिष्यते; एकवच्चास्यकर्थे भवति अन्यतरस्याम् ॥
vRtti_eng: A neuter noun, which has the same form, only differing in affix, is optionally retained, and the other is dropped, and it is like a singular number.

A neuter prevails over a masculine or feminine noun when spoken of along with them, provided that the words differ in gender signs only; but radically they be the same. Thus आलस्यो मैथुनं निद्रा सेव्यमानं विवर्द्धते 'Idleness, lust, and sleep, indulged in, increase.' Here the adjective '_sevyyamanam_' is in the neuter gender, though it qualifies the words '_alasya_' which is in the masculine, '_maithunam_' which is in the neuter, and '_nidra_' which is in the feminine gender. The rule, therefore, may be stated in these words, that where one adjective qualifies several nouns, in different genders, but one of which must be neuter, the adjective agrees with the neuter.

The above illustration also shows that the neuter _ekasesha_ may be in the singular number.

If the neuter is compounded with another neuter, this rule does not apply. Thus शुक्लं + शुक्लं + शुक्लं = शुक्लानि; the word is in the plural; there is no _ekavadbhava_.

The words तल्लक्षणश्चेदेव विशेषः of _sutra_ (I. 2. 65) governs this _sutra_ also: thus शुक्लश्च कम्बलः, शुक्ला च वृहतिका, शुक्लं च वस्त्रं. "The white (masc.) blanket, the white (fem) wrapper, and the white (neut.) garment," may all he spoken of collectively as शुक्लं (neut.).
