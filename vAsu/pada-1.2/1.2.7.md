sutra: मृडमृदगुधकुषक्लिशवदवसः क्त्वा
vRtti: मृड मृद गुध कुष क्लिश वद वस् इत्येतेभ्यः परः क्त्वाप्रत्ययः किद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix _ktva_ is _kit_ after _mrid_ 'to be gracious,' _mrid_ ' to squeeze,' _gudh_ 'to wrap up,' _kush_ 'to tear,' _klis_ 'to suffer,' _vad_ 'to speak' and _vas_ 'to dwell.'"

After these seven verbs, the gerundial _ktva_ is _kit_. It might be said, what was the necessity of this _sutra_? The affix _ktva_ is clearly a _kit_ affix, as it is marked with the diacritical letter क्, and it was useless to call it a _kit_ affix after these verbs. The reason of this apparent repitition is this. Though _ktva_ is a _kit_ affix generally; yet there is a later _sutra_ in this chapter (I. 2. 18) which declares that the prefix क्त्वा is not कित्, if it is preceded by the intermediate इ. Or in other words, if क्त्वा is added to those verbs, which are called सेट् verbs, viz., that take an intermediate इ, it is not then _kit_. Thus the verb शी 'to sleep' is सेट्. Therefore शी + इ + त्वा = शे + इ + त्वा = शायित्वा.

Now it happens that all the seven verbs mentioned in the _sutra_ are सेट् verbs, and take an intermediate इ. The क्त्वा before these verbs would have lost its _kitness_ by virtue of _sutra_ 18; therefore arose the necessity of this _sutra_, to provide in anticipation an exception to that _sutra_, in favour of these verbs, where the affix _ktva_ is necessarily _kit_. Thus we have मृडित्वा 'being gracious,' मृदित्वा 'having squeezed,' गुधित्वा 'having wrapped' कुषित्वा 'having torn,' क्लिशित्वा 'having suffered,' उदित्वा 'having spoken,' उषित्वा 'having dwelt.' The व v of वद् and वस् are changed into उ by the rule of _Samprasarana_ (VI. 1. 15).

Moreover in the case of the verbs गुद्, कुष् and क्लिश्, _sutra_ 26 would have made क्त्वा optionally _kit_; the present _sutra_ makes it necessarily so.
