sutra: पिता मात्रा
vRtti: मात्रासह वचने पितृशब्दः शिष्यते अन्यतरस्याम् ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _pitri_, 'father', is optionally only retained when spoken of along with _matri_, 'mother.'

Thus पिता + माता = पितरौ 'father and mother, or parents' or मातापितरौ. The verse quoted under _sutra_ (I.2.68) illustrates this _sutra_ also. There the word _pitarau_' has been explained by all commentators as "father and mother." The word "_ekavad_" of the last _sutra_ does not govern this _sutra_; though the _anuvritti_ of 'optionally' is to be read into this.
