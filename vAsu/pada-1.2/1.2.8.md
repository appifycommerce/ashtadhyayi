sutra: रुदविदमुषग्रहिस्वपिप्रच्छः संश्च
vRtti: रुद विद मुष ग्रहि स्वपि प्रच्छ इत्येतेभ्यः संश्च क्त्वा च कितौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affixes _ktva_ and _san_ (III. 1. 7) are _kit_, after _rud_ 'to weep,' _vid_ 'to know,' _mush_ 'to steal,' _grah_ 'to seize,' _svap_ 'to sleep,' and _prachchh_ 'to ask.'"

After the above mentioned verbs the _ktva_ though taking an intermediate इ, and the affix सन् are कित्. The affix सन् is employed in forming desiderative verbs. The न् of सन् is इत्, the real affix being स. The root is reduplicated before this सन् affix. Thus रुदित्वा 'having cried,' रुरुदिषति 'he wishes to cry'; विदित्वा 'having known,' विविदिषति 'he wishes to know'; गृहीत्वा (VI. 1. 16.) 'having taken,' जिघृक्षति 'he wishes to take'; मुषित्वा 'having stolen,' मुमुषिषति 'he wishes to steal'; सुप्त्वा (VI. 1. 15) 'having slept,' सुषुप्सति 'he wishes to sleep,' पृष्ट्वा (VI. I. 16) 'having asked' पिपृच्छिषति 'he wishes to ask.' The verb ग्रह् is changed into गृह्, स्वप् into सुप्, प्रच्छ् into पृच्छ before _kit_ affixes by _samprasarana_ (VI. 1. 16.)

The _ktva_ and _san_ would have been optionally _kit_ after the verbs रुद्, विद् and मुष् by virtue of Rule 26 of this chapter, but this _sutra_ makes them necessarily so, after these three verbs. In the case of the verb ग्रह्, these affixes are _kit_ by virtue of this _sutra_ only. In the case of the verbs स्वप् and प्रच्छ् the affix क्त्वा is of course _kit_, because these two verbs are _anit_, that is, they do not take the intermediate इ; and therefore the क्त्वा being directly affixed to them, and rule 18 not applying, the indicatory k would make it _kit_. In reference to these verbs, therefore, the present _sutra_ teaches something new, only with regard to the affix सन्, by making that also _kit_. The verb प्रच्छ् takes the intermediate इ when the affix सन् follows, by virtue of _sutra_ (VII. 2. 75).
