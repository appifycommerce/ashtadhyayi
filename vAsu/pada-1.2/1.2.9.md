sutra: इको झल्
vRtti: इगन्ताद्धातोः परो झलादिः सन् किद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _san_ beginning with a letter of the _Pratyahara_ _jhal_ is like _kit_, after verbs ending in _ik_ vowels.
---
In this _sutra_ there is the _anuvritti_ of सन् only and not of क्त्वा. The _sutra_ literally translated means:-"After _ik_ the _jhal_." The _Pratyahara_ इक् contains the four letters इ, उ, ऋ, लृ. The _Pratyahara_ झल् contains all the consonants, except the nasals and the liquids. After the verbs ending in इक् the desiderative suffix सन् is _kit_, when it is झलादि, that is to say when the affix सन् does not take the intermediate इ. The affix सन् is an affix which begins with स् a letter of the झल् class. But if the intermediate इ is added before it, it is no longer a झलादि affix, and in that case it is not कित्. Thus from जि 'to conquer,' which is a verb ending in इक्, we have जिगीषति 'he wishes to conquer', यु 'to mix' युयूषति; so also कृ 'to do,' चिकीर्षति, तृ 'to cross' तितीर्षति, भू 'to be' बुभूषति ।

If however, verbs ending in इ or उ or ऋ or लृ, take an intermediate इ, they likewise take _guna_. As:- स्मि 'to smile' takes _guna_, and makes its desiderative सिस्मयिषति.

The झलादि सन् is not _kit_ after verbs ending in any other letter than the इक्. As पिपासति (from पा) 'he wishes to drink.' So from स्था we have तिष्ठासति.

The object of making the affix सन् _kit_ affix after verbs ending in _ik_ vowels, is to prevent the _guna_ of the vowel of the root, as in चिचीषति 'wishes to collect', तुष्टूषति 'wishes to praise.' To this it might be objected "this cannot be : for rule (VI. 4. 16) (when सन् beginning with a _jhal_, i.e., not preceded by the augment इट् follows, a long vowel is the substitute of verbs ending in a vowel, and of the verbs हन् and गम्) would prevent _guna_ by substituting long vowel." To this it may be replied: "if rule (VI. 4. 16), enjoining long vowel, debars rule (VII. 3. 84) requiring _guna_, it should a fortiori debar rule (VI. 4. 51) which requires the elision of the affix णि before _Ardhadhatuka_ affixes not taking the augment इट्. But evidently that is not so; for the elision of णि is not debarred by (VI. 4. 16). Therefore, the present _sutra_ is made, so that even by giving scope to the rule of lengthening, the affix सन् be treated as कित्." Thus in चिचीषति scope is given to rule (VI. 4. 16), and the vowel is lengthened. But this rule in its turn will be debarred in those cases where rule (VI. 4. 51) will apply : in such cases the maxim contained in (I. 4. 2) is our guide, and a subsequent rule will debar a prior rule of _Panini_ when both find their scope in a single case. Thus in forming the desiderative of the verb ज्ञप् 'to inform,' both the rules (VI. 4. 16) and (VI. 4. 51) present themselves, but the latter prevails. The verb ज्ञप् belongs to the _churadi_ class of verbs, and takes the affix णिच्. Thus ज्ञप् + णिच् + सन् + तिप्; here the present _sutra_ comes into force, and सन् being treated as कित्, the _guna_ of the इ of ज्ञपि is prevented. Thus _sutra_ (VII. 3. 84) requiring _guna_ being set aside, _sutra_ (VI. 4. 51) comes into play, and causes the elision of णिच् and we have ज्ञप् + स + ति = ज्ञीप्सति (VII. 4. 55) (आ changed to ई) 'he wishes to inform.'
