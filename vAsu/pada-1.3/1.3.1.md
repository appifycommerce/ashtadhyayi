sutra: भूवादयो धातवः
vRtti: भू इत्येवमादयः शब्दा क्रियावचना धातु संज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The words beginning with _bhu_ 'to become,' and denoting action, are called _dhatu_ or verbal roots.

This defines the word _dhatu_ or root. The list of Sanskrit verbs begins with the root _bhu_ 'to be.' Sanskrit grammarians have divided all verbs into ten classes, according to certain modifications which their roots undergo before certain terminations. The ten classes are as follows:-

1. _Bhu_ class. 2. _Ad_. 3. _Hu_. 4. _Div_. 5. _Su_, 6. _Tud_. 7. _Rudh_. 8. _Tan_. 9. _Kri_. 10. _Chur_.

There are about two thousand verbs, and they are conjugated in two forms, some taking the _Parasmaipada_ terminations only, the others the _Atmanepada_ terminations and some both. The present chapter deals mostly with rules determining the nature of the verbal root, whether it is _Parasmaipadi_ or _Atmanepadi_ or both. A verb expresses action. The word _dhatu_ is a word coined by older grammarians than _Panini_ and they employed the term in denoting a word expressing action. Here also, therefore, the word _dhatu_ means a word which expresses action.

The वा in the _sutra_ is for the sake of auspiciousness; for the regular _sandhi_ of भू + आदि is भ्वादि and not भूवादि; while Dr. Ballantyne considers that वा is a separate root : he translates the _sutra_ thus:- "Let the verbal roots _bhu_ 'be,' _va_ 'blow' and the like be called _dhatu_."
