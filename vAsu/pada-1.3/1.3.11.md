sutra: स्वरितेनाधिकारः
vRtti: स्वरितो नाम स्वरविशेषो वर्णधर्म्मः तेन चिह्नेनाधिकारो वेदितव्यः ॥
vRtti_eng: In these aphorisms, when a word is marked with a _svarita_ accent, by that an _adhikara_ or a governing rule is to be understood.
---
When in this collection of grammatical _sutras_, there is any _sutra_ that has a circumflex accent, it denotes that it is either the beginning of a subject and the subsequent _sutras_ are governed by it, or that it ends a subject and separates the previous _sutras_ from the following.

As a rule, the _sutras_ are not marked with accents; it is therefore from commentaries that one has to learn whether a _sutra_ has a _svarita_ or not. Thus the following _sutras_ must evidently have _svarita_ as they are governing _sutras_; प्रत्ययः (III. I. 1.) धातोः (III. I. 91), अङ्गस्य (VI. 4. 1), भस्य (VI. 4. 129).
