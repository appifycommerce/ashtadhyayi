sutra: कर्त्तरि कर्म व्यतिहारे
vRtti: कर्म व्यतिहारे तद्विशिष्ट क्रिया वचनाद्धातोरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In denoting the agent, when reciprocity of action is to be expressed, the affixes of the _Atmanepada_ are employed.

---
The active or कर्तृवाच्य verbs when denoting reciprocal action are _atmanepadi_. As, व्यतिपचन्ते, 'they cook for each other,' व्यतिलुनते 'he performs cutting of wood which was the appropriate office of another.'

The words "reciprocity or interchange of action" of this _sutra_ govern and are understood in the two following _sutras_ also.

The word _karma_ in the _sutra_ means action and not the technical '_karma_' meaning 'object' and the word _vyatihara_ means reciprocity or interchange. When an action which was appropriate to one person is performed by another, whose duty it was not, that is called 'interchange of action.' When such interchange is not meant _Paras_. is used. As लुनन्ति 'they cut.' The word _kartari_ here is used for the sake of the subsequent aphorism (1.3.78), which see.
