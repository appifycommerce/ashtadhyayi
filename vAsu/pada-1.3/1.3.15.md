vRtti: गत्यर्थेभ्यो हिंसार्थेभ्यश्च धातुभ्यः कर्म व्यतिहारे आत्मनेपदं न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After verbs having the sense of 'motion,' or 'injury,' when expressing interchange of action, the _Atmanepada_ affixes are not used.

The word 'not' of this _sutra_ is understood in the subsequent _sutra_.

Vart:- This prohibition extends to the verbs हस् 'to laugh,' and the rest. As व्यतिहसन्ति, व्यतिजल्पन्ति, व्यतिपठन्ति ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be made of the verbs हरति 'to injure,' as संप्रहरन्ते राजानः ॥
