vRtti_eng: "After the verb _kri_ 'to purchase,' when preceded by _pari_, _vi_ or _ava_, the _Atmanepada_ affix is employed, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent."
---
The verb डुक्रीञ् 'to buy or barter,' has an indicatory ञ् and therefore, by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72) it will be _Atmanepadi_ when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present _sutra_, therefore, refers to cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

The root क्री 'to buy' as a general rule takes the terminations of both _padas_, but when it is preceded by _pari_, _vi_, or _ava_, it is restricted to _Atmanepada_ terminations. As प्ररीक्रीणीते 'he buys'; विक्रीणीते 'he sells'; अवक्रीणीते 'he buys.'

The word _pari_, _vi_, and _ava_ must be _upasargas_, therefore, in the following example, there is no _Atmanepada_ termination, because the _vi_ there is not a preposition but a noun, as, बहुविक्रीणाति वनम्.
