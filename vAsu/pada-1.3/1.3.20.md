sutra: आङो दोऽनास्य विहरणे
vRtti: आङ् पूर्वाद्ददातेरनास्यविहरणे वर्त्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _da_ 'to give,' preceded by _an_, and when not meaning 'to open the mouth,' the _Atmanepada_ affix is used, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent."
---
The root दा is generally both _Parasmaipadi_ and _Atmanepadi_ (see _Sutra_. 72). But when preceded by the preposition आ, it is restriced to the _atmanepada_ As विद्यामादत्ते 'he acquires knowledge.' But when it means "to widen the mouth" whether actually or metaphorically, it is _parasmaipadi_. As आस्यं व्याददाति. 'He expands his own mouth.'

Vart:- The prohibition also applies when the action is similar to the act of opening the mouth. As विपादिकां व्याददाति 'he opens the tumour.' कूलं व्याददाति नदी 'the river breaks the bank.'

Vart:- When the action does not affect the agents' own body the verb is _atmanepadi_, as व्याददतेपिपीलिकाः पतंगस्य मुखम्, 'the ants open the mouth of a locust.'
