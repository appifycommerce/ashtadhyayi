sutra: प्रकाशनस्थेयाख्ययोश्च
vRtti: प्रकाशने स्थेयाख्यायां च तिष्ठतेरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _stha_ when meaning 'to indicate one's intentions to another,' or 'to make an award as an arbitrator,' the _Atmanepada_ affix is employed.

---
The word _prakasana_ means disclosing one's intentions. The word _stheyakhya_ is a compound of _stheya_ 'arbitrator; and _akhya_ 'name.'

As तिष्ठते जायापत्ये 'the wife expresses her wish to the husband;' त्वयितिष्ठते 'he refers to thee for settlement;' संशय्य कर्णादिषु तिष्ठते यः, 'who, when he is in doubt, has recourse to _Karna_ as his judge or umpire.'
