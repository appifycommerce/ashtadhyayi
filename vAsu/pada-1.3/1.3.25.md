sutra: उपान्मन्त्रकरणे
vRtti: उपपूर्वात्तिष्ठतेर्मन्त्रकरणेऽर्थेवर्त्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _stha_, preceded by _upa_, when meaning 'to adore,' the _Atmanepada_ affix is used.
---
As ऐन्द्र्यागार्हपत्यमुपतिष्ठते 'he approaches with prayers or worships the _Garhapatya_ fire with _aindra_ hymns.'

If it does not mean 'praising with hymns' the terminations which the verb takes, are those of the _Parasmaipada_, as भर्तारमुपतिष्ठति यौवनेन 'she approaches the husband through youth.'

Vart:- The verb स्था after the preposition उप takes the terminations of the _atmanepada_ when meaning 'worshipping a deity,' 'to approach for intercourse or uniting or joining,' 'to form friendship with,' and 'to lead to as a way.' Thus:- 1st _Deva_ _puja_ आदित्यमुपतिष्ठते 'he worships the _Aditya_.' 2. _Sangati_ _karana_ पतिमुपतिष्ठते नारी 'the wife approaches the husband,' रथिकानुपतिष्ठते 'forms union with charioteers.' 3. _Mitri_ _karana_ सन्तमुपतिष्ठते साधुः 'the good man approaches the saints to make friends with.' What is the difference between _Sangati_-_karana_ and _Mitri_-_karana_ ? _Sangati_-_karana_ means drawing near and approaching together in space, as गंगायमुनामुपतिष्ठते 'the Ganges joins the _Jumna_.' While the friendly relations may be established without coming in physical contact. 4. _Patha_ :- अयं पन्थाः स्रुघ्नमुपतिष्ठते 'this road leads to _Srughna_.'

Vart:- It must be stated that the _Atmanepada_ is optional when the sense is 'desire of getting.' As भिक्षुको ब्राह्मणकुलमुपतिष्ठते or उपतिष्ठति 'a beggar waits at the place of a _Brahmana_ with the desire of getting something.'
