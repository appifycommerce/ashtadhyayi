sutra: उद्विभ्यां तपः
vRtti: उद् विइत्येवं पूर्वात् तपतेरकर्मकक्रियावचनादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _tapa_ 'to shine,' when used intransitively, and preceded by _ut_ or _vi_, the _Atmanepada_ affix is employed."

As उत्तपते or वितपते विद्याया विद्यार्थी 'The scholar shines with knowledge.' But in transitive verbs, it is _Parasmaipadi_. As उत्तपति सुवर्णंसुवर्णकारः 'the goldsmith heats the gold,' वितपति पृष्ठं सविता 'the sun heats the back.'

Vart:- It must be stated that the terminations are of the _atmanepada_, though the verb _ut_-_tapa_ or _vi_-_tapa_ be transitive, when the object is some limb of one's own body. As उत्तपते पाणिम् or वितपते पाणिम् or पृष्ठम् 'he heats his own hand or back.' The word स्वाङ्ग means one's own body and not the _paribhashika_ or the technical स्वाङ्ग meaning "a thing which not being liquid or gaseous and being capable of being perceived by the senses, and not being one produced by a change from the natural state, exists in a living being and though found elsewhere actually or at any particular time, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually (not figuratively) the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being." (See (IV. 1. 54. स्वाङ्गाच्चोपसर्जनादसंयोगोपधात्). Therefore not so in the following देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य पृष्टमुत्तपति '_Devadatta_ heats the back of _Yajnadatta_.' When the preposition is other than _ut_ or _vi_, _parasmaipada_ affix is employed; as, निष्टपति.
