sutra: निस मुपविभ्यो ह्वः
vRtti: नि सम उप वि इत्येवं पूर्वाद् ह्वयतेर्द्धातोरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verbs _hve_ 'to call,' preceded by _ni_, _sam_, _upa_, and _vi_, the _Atmanepada_ is used, even, when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
---
The verb ह्वेः 'to call' whether transitive or intransitive is _Atmanepadi_ after the above prepositions. The condition of being Intransitive does not apply to this _sutra_, and from this _sutra_ forward general rules of _Atmanepada_ are treated of. As निह्वयते, संह्वयते, उपह्वयते ॥

The verb ह्वे is marked in the _Dhatupatha_ with a ञ् and therefore, by _sutra_ 72 of this Chapter, it will take the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ when the direct fruit of the action accrues to the agent. But even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the verb _hve_ takes the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ when preceded by the above prefixes.

Vart:- The verbs अस् 'to throw' and ऊह 'to note' take optionally _Atmanepada_ affixes when compounded with _upasargas_. As निरस्यति—०ते 'he casts out,' समूहति—०ते 'he collects.'
