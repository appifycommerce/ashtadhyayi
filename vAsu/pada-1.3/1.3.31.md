sutra: स्पर्द्धायामाङः
vRtti: स्पर्द्धायां विषये आङ् पूर्वाद् ह्वयतेरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _hve_, when meaning \"to challenge\" and preceded by _an_, the _Atmanepada_ is used, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

As मल्लो मल्लामाह्वयते 'an athlete challenges another athlete (in order to conquer him)'; छात्रश्छात्रमाह्वयते 'one student emulates with another student.'

This _sutra_ is also for the purpose of showing that the root _hve_ takes the _Atmanepada_ terminations even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

The word _spardha_ means to emulate, to vie, to desire, to conquer another. When the verb _hve_ has not the above signification, it takes the terminations of the _parasmaipada_. As गामाह्वयति गोपालः 'the cowherd calls the cows.'
