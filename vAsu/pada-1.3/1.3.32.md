sutra: गन्धनावक्षेपणसेवनसाहसिक्यप्रतियत्नप्रकथनोपयोगेषु कृञः
vRtti: गन्धनादिष्वर्थेषु वर्त्तमानात् करोतेरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _kri_ when meaning 'to divulge,' 'to revile,' 'to serve,' 'to use violence,' 'to cause change,' 'to recite,' and 'to do an act tending to effect a desired purpose,' the _Atmanepada_ is used, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent."

The verb कृञ् by _sutra_ 72 would take the affixes of the _Atmanepada_ when the direct fruit of the action accrues to the agent. This _sutra_ has been begun to show that this verb takes the _Atmanepada_ terminations under certain circumstances even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

The word _gandhana_ comes from the root _gandh_ 'to injure,' of _churadi_ class and means to inform against another maliciously with the object of injuring such person. _Avakshepana_ means 'to revile', 'to over-come,' _sevana_ means 'to obey and serve,' _sahasikya_ means 'an act of violence,' _pratiyatna_ means, 'imparting a new quality or virtue,' _prakathana_ means 'to narrate fully,' _upayoga_ means 'the disposal of a thing for the object of attaining &c.'

Thus उत्कुरुते, उदाकुरुते a means he informs against; (2) श्येनो वर्तिकामुदाकुरुते 'the hawk overcomes or reviles a snail,' (3) गणिकानुपकुरुते 'he serves the prostitutes,' महामात्राननुकुरुते 'he serves the _mahamatra_,' (4) परदारान् प्रकुरुते 'he outrages another's wife,' (5) एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the fuel gives a new quality (boils) to the water (or he prepares the wood and water for a sacrifice).' The object of the verb _kri_ takes the affix of the sixth case i. e. genitive, only when the verb means _pratiyatna_, see _Sutra_ (II. 3. 53) (कृञः प्रतियत्ने) । Therefore _udakasya_, though an object, has genitive form. The verb takes the augment सुट् only when it is preceded by _upa_ and signifies _pratiyatna_, see (VI. 1. 139). (उपात् प्रतियत्न वैकृत वाक्याध्याहारेषु) ॥ Therefore, there is the insertion of sibilant in _upaskurute_. (5) गाथाः प्रकुरुते 'he recites stories,' जनापवादान् प्रकुरुते 'he recites slander,' (6) शतं प्रकुरुते 'he devotes a hundred pieces of money, for the sake of merit.' सहस्रं प्रकुरुते 'he devotes a thousand.'

Why do we say in these senses? Witness कटं करोति 'he makes a mat.' In this case the _atmanepada_ affix is not employed.

The verb _kri_ is understood in the three succeeding _sutras_.
