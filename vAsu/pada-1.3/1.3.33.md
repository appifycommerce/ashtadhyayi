sutra: अधेः प्रसहने
vRtti: अधि पूर्वात् करोतेः प्रसहने वर्त्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _kri_ preceded by _adhi_, when the sense is that of 'overcoming or defeat,' the _Atmanepada_ is used, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent."

This _sutra_ is commenced to show that _kri_ may take the _atmanepada_ affix even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word _prasahana_ means 'to overcome, to be not defeated,' As तमधिचक्रे 'he overcame him or he was not defeated by him.'

Why do we say, 'in the sense of to overcome?' Witness अर्थमधिकरोति 'he learns the meaning' in which example the _atmanepada_ affix is not employed.

The necessity of making a separate _sutra_ of this rule, instead of including it in the last aphorism, arose with the object of giving a distinctive meaning to the prefix _adhi_.
