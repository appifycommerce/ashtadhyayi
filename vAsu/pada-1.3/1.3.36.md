vRtti_eng: "After the verb _ni_ 'to lead,' when used in the sense of 'to guide so as to render the person guided worthy,' 'to lift up,' 'to make one a spiritual guide,' 'to determine the true sense,' to employ on wages,' 'to pay as debt,' and 'to give as in charity,' even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the _Atmanepada_ is used."

This _sutra_ is begun in order to show that the verb नी may take the terminations of the _Atmanepada_, even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, in the following cases, viz, when it means to 'respect' &c.

_Sammanana_ means to respect; as नयते चर्वी लोकायते 'the _Charvi_ gives instruction in the _Lokayata_ _sastra_.' The word _charvi_ primarily means intelligence, and by secondary use it has been extended to the preceptor also; such a preceptor gives instruction, in _Lokayata_ _Sastra_, that is to say, having established the truth of the doctrines of that philosophy by argumentation, imparts them to the pupils. Those doctrines being thus established by reason, become respected (_Sanmanita_) and honored.

_Utsanjana_, 'to throw up, or lift up,' as माणवकमुदानयते 'he lifts up _Manavaka_.'

_Acharya_-_karana_ 'acting as a teacher,' that is to say, to bring a boy near oneself in such a way, that being so brought near (_upa_-_neta_), he may himself become an _acharya_, As माणवकमुपनयते 'he initiates _Manavaka_ (i.e., making himself the preceptor he brings the boy near himself.')

_Jnana_ means 'knowledge, a demonstrated verity.' As नयते चर्वीलोकायते 'the _Charvi_ investigates the truth of the _Lokayata_ doctrine.'

_Bhriti_ means 'wages.' As कर्मकारानुपनयते 'he employs the servants on hire or wages.'

_Viganana_ means the paying off as a tribute, debts &c. As मद्रा करं विनयन्ते, the _Madras_ pay the tax due to the king, that is, they discharge the debt.'

_Vyaya_ means 'allotment of money on works of merit &c.' As शतं विनयते 'he expends a hundred pieces on religious acts.' सहस्रं विनयते 'he devotes a thousand.

Why do we say, in these senses? Witness अजां नयति ग्रामम् 'he carries the goat to the village.' Here there is no _Atmanepada_ affix, as the verb has not any one of the above significations.
