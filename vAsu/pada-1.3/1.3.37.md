sutra: कर्तृस्थे चाशरीरे कर्म्मणि
vRtti: नयतेः कर्त्तादेवदत्तादिर्लकारवाच्यः कर्तृस्थे कर्म्मण्यशरीरे सति नयतेरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _ni_, when it governs an incorporeal object existing in the agent, as its object, the _Atmanepada_ is used.

---
The verb नी is _Atmanepadi_ when governing an object which has no material body, but is an abstract noun, that is an object which has abstract but no concrete existence; and when such an object has its seat in a portion of the agent of the verb. As क्रोधं विनयते 'he subdues his own anger,' मन्युं विनयते 'he suppresses anger.'

The word _sarira_ means the body of living beings, any portion of such body is also called _sarira_.

The object must reside in the agent, (_kartristha_), otherwise the verb will be _parasmaipadi_. As देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य क्रोधं विनयति '_Devadatta_ removes _Yajnadatta_'s anger.'

The object moreover must be immaterial, otherwise the affix will be of _parasmaipada_. As गडुं विनयति 'he removes his own wort.' घाठां विनयति 'he bows his neck.'

Why do we say 'in the case of an object ?' Witness बुद्ध्या विनयति 'he is submissive through knowledge,' प्रज्ञया विनयति. Here the verb विनयति has not taken an accusative case, but is in construction with an instrumental case, and therefore the present rule does not apply.
