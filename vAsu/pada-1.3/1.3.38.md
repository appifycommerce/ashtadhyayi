sutra: वृत्तिसर्गतायनेषु क्रमः
vRtti: वृत्त्यादिष्वर्थेषु क्रमेर्धातोरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _kram_ 'to move' when used, in the senses of 'continuity,' 'energy' and 'development,' the _Atmanepada_ is employed."

The word '_kram_' governs the succeeding _sutras_ up to (I. 3. 43) and is understood in them all.

The verb _kram_ by _sutra_ (I. 3. 78) (after the rest, let the _parasmaipada_ affixes be employed in marking the agent), would have taken the affixes of the _parasmaipada_; the present aphorism enjoins _Atmanepada_ affixes in certain cases when the verb means to have a taste for &c.

_Vritti_ 'continuity' means unobstructed, or want of interruption (i. e., a taste for, or facility in, anything), _sarga_ 'energy' means application, resolution and determination. _Tayana_ 'development' means increase and growth.

As (1) ऋक्ष्वस्य क्रमते बुद्धिः - 'his reason proceeds unobstructed through the _Rig_. scriptures i. e., he can easily comprehend the _Rig_.' (2). व्याकरणाध्ययनाय क्रमते 'the pupil shows energy or exerts to study the grammar.' (3). अस्मिनशास्त्राणि क्रमन्ते 'the _shastras_ are developed in him.'

Why in these senses only? Witness अपक्रामति 'he runs away.'
