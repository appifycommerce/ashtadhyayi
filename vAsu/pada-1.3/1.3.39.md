sutra: उपराभ्याम्
vRtti: उपपरापूर्वात् क्रमतेर्वृत्त्यादिष्वर्थेषु वर्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _kram_, preceded by _upa_ and _para_, when used in the senses of continuity, energy and development, the _Atmanepada_ is employed.

The words _vritti_ &c., of the last _sutra_ are understood here also. Why has this been made a separate _sutra_ and not included in the last? The reason is to make a restrictive rule in the cases of _upasargas_; that is to say, only in the cases of the _upasargas_ _upa_ and _para_, there is _atmanepada_ affix; but not so when any other _upasarga_ precedes the verb _kram_, though the sense may be of continuity &c. Thus उपक्रमते 'he commences to advance,' पराक्रमते 'he marches to attack.'

Why do we say after the _upasargas_ '_upa_ and _para_'? Because, after any other preposition the affix will be of the _parasmaipada_; as संक्रामति 'he makes progress.' If the sense is not that of "continuity" &c., _parasmaipada_ will be employed, as उपक्रामति, पराक्रामति.
