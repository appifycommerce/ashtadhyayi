sutra: न विभक्तौ तुस्माः
vRtti: पूर्वेण प्राप्तायामित्संज्ञायां विभक्तौ वर्त्तमानानां तवर्ग सकार मकाराणां प्रतिषेध उच्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: "The final dental consonants, and the final स् and म् are not इत् in affixes called _vibhakti_ or inflective affixes."
---
This is an exception to the previous _sutra_ which declared all final consonants to be इत्. In case terminations, the final त्, थ्, द्, ध्, न्, स्, and म्, are not इत्. Thus the case termination of nominative plural is जस्. Here the final स्, though a consonant is not an इत्; and is not rejected, as in ब्राह्मणाः ॥ The word तु in the _sutra_ means the letters of the class त by virtue of _sutra_ 69 Chapter I. (see _ante_). The word _vibhakti_ will be defined later on in _sutra_ (I. 4. 104). These are terminations applied to nouns in declining them through various cases; and to verbs in conjugating them. Thus in _sutra_ (VII. 1. 12), (टाङसिङसामिनात्स्याः) the _vibhaktis_ इन्, आत् and स्य replace टा, ङसि and ङस्. Here the final त् of the affix आत् is not indicatory and hence not rejected, as वृक्षात्. Similarly verbal terminations तस् and थस् as पचतः, पचथः ॥ So also the final म् as ताम् and तम् in अपचताम् and अपचतम् ॥

This exception applies only to _vibhaktis_ and not to affixes in general. Thus the finals of यत् (III. 1. 97 अचोयत्;) युस् (V. 2. 123, ऊर्णाया युस्) and श्रम् (III. 1. 78 युधादिभ्य श्रम् ।) are इत् and are rejected. This exception, however, does not apply to the _vibhakti_ अत् (in (V. 3. 12) किमोऽत् or (III. 4. 106), इटोऽत्). In those two _sutras_ the final त् of the _vibhakti_ is इत्. The reason of this is, that the present _sutra_ is an _anitya_ _sutra_, i. e. a rule not of general application. In _sutra_ (V. 3. 24), (इदमस्थमुः) we find, 'the word इदम् takes the _vibhakti_ थमु in the sense of mode or manner.' As इद् + थमु = इत्थम्, 'in this manner.' Now थमु is a _vibhakti_ by (V. 3. 1). (प्राग्दिशो विभक्तिः), the उ is इत्, the real _vibhakti_ is थम्. Now had the present _sutra_ been of universal application, then there would have been no necessity of adding this उ as indicatory letter, which has been evidently added to save the म् of थम् from becoming an इत्. This _sutra_ is consequently an _antiya_ _sutra_.
