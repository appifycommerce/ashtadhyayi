sutra: वेः पादविहरणे
vRtti: विपूर्वात् क्रमतेः पादविहरणेऽर्थे वर्त्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _kram_, preceded by _vi_, the _Atmanepada_ is employed, when used in the sense of 'placing of foot-steps.'"

As वाजी विक्रमते 'the horse is pacing.' The term _vikramana_ is applied to the special movements of horse &c.

Though in the _Dhatupatha_ (catalogue of verbal roots), the verb क्रमि and क्रमु have the meanings of _pada_-_viharana_ and _pada_-_vikshepa_, that is "throwing or placing of foot," and so it might be objected that the present _sutra_ is a useless repetition, yet as verbs have various other meanings than what is assigned to them in the _dhatupatha_, the present _sutra_ is not unnecessary.

Why do we say "in the sense of throwing of foot"? In any other sense, the terminations will be those of the _parasmaipada_. As विक्रामति अजिनसन्धिः 'the fold of the antilope skin is ruptured.'
