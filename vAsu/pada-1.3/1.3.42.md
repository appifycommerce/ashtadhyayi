sutra: प्रोपाभ्यां समर्थाभ्याम्
vRtti: प्र उप इत्येताभ्यां परस्मात् क्रमतेरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _kram_, the _Atmanepada_ is employed when it is preceded by _pra_ and _upa_, both conveying the same sense; viz. that of 'beginning an action.'

As प्रक्रमते भोक्तुम्, उपक्रमते भोक्तुम् 'he commences to eat' &c.

The prefixes _pra_ and _upa_ are synonyms, when they denote the commencement of an action.

Why do we say, "when they are synonyms." Witness the following पूर्वेद्युः प्रक्रामति अपरेद्युरुपक्रामति 'he goes during the first part of the day and he comes back during the latter part of the day.' Here in one case the sense is "to go," in another it means "to return."

Why in the latter case of '_aparedyur_ _upakramati_' there is not _Atmanepada_ by virtue of _sutra_ (I. 3. 39) _ante_, as there is the _upasarga_ _upa_ here? The answer is that Rule (I. 3. 39) is not applicable, as that rule is limited by the condition of the sense of 'continuity' &c. while in the present _sutra_, that limitation is not applicable.
