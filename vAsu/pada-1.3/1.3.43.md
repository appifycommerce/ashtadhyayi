sutra: अनुपसर्गाद्वा
vRtti: उपसर्ग वियुक्तात् क्रमतेरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _kram_, the _Atmanepada_ is optionally employed, when it is not preceded by any preposition.

---
The root '_kram_' may always be conjugated as _Atmanepadi_ when not having any _upasarga_. The _upasarga_ will be defined in (I.4.59). The option allowed by this _sutra_ is an example of what is technically known as _aprapta_ _vibhasa_ viz., an option which is not an alternative limitation to a general rule already found or known.

Examples: क्रमते or क्रामति 'he goes over.' Why do we say 'when it is without any preposition ?' For no option is allowed when it takes preposition. As संक्रामति.
