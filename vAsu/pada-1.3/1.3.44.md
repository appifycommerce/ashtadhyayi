sutra: अपह्नवे ज्ञः
vRtti: जानातेरपह्नवे वर्त्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _jna_, when used in the sense of 'denying,' the _Atmanepada_ is employed.

---
The root _jna_ which ordinarily means 'to know' and is _parasmaipadi_ by rule (I.3.78), becomes _Atmanepadi_ when through the virtue of any prefix it means 'to deceive:' as अपजानीते 'he deceives,' शतमपजानीते 'he denies the debt of a hundred rupees,' सहस्रमपजानीते 'denies a thousand.'

Why do we say when meaning "to deny ?" Observe:- न त्वं किंचिदपि ज्ञानासि 'thou knowest not anything.'
