sutra: अकर्मकाच्च
vRtti: जानातेरकर्मकादकर्मकक्रियावचनादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And when used intransitively, after the verb _jna_, the _Atmanepada_ is employed, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

As सर्पिषो जानीते मधुनो जानीते 'he engages in sacrifice by means of clarified butter or honey.' (See (II. 3. 51)).

This _Atmanepadi_ form of _jna_ is employed when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. From _sutra_ (I. 3. 76) it will be seen that when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, the verb is _Atmanepadi_.

How in the above example the verb _jna_ is intransitive? Because the word _sarpih_ is not the object of knowledge, but it is an instrument of sacrifice, into which one engages from complete knowledge (_jnana_); and it (_sarpishah_) is in the genitive case by virtue of (II. 3. 51) (ज्ञोऽविदर्थस्य करणे) by which the instrumental _karaka_ of the _jna_ is put in the genitive case.

Why do we say of "Intransitive"? Because in the transitive it is _parasmaipadi_, as स्वरेण पुत्रं जानाति 'he knows (recognizes) the son by his voice.'
