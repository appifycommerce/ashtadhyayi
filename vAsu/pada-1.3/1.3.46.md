sutra: संप्रतिभ्यामनाध्याने
vRtti: संप्रतिइत्येवं पूर्वाज्जानातेरनाध्याने वर्त्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _jna_, precede by _sam_, and _prati_, the _Atmanepada_ is employed, when not used in the sense of \"remembering with regret.\"
---
The word _jna_ is understood in this _sutra_: and the aphorism applies to that _jna_ which is used in the transitive. As शतं संजानीते 'he looks for a hundred,' So सहस्रं प्रतिजानीते 'he promises a thousand.'

Why do we say when 'not meaning remembering with regret?' Because it is not _Atmanepadi_, when it conveys that meaning. Thus मातुः संजानाति 'he remembers with regret his mother,' पितुः संजानाति ॥
