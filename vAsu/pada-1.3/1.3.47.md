By _sutra_ (I.3.78), _vad_ generally takes the terminations of the _Parasmaipada_. By the present _sutra_, it takes also the affixes of the _Atmanepada_ when having certain meanings.

_Bhasana_, (shining) means to illumine as वदते चर्वी लोकायते. The _charvi_ illumines the _Lokayat_ _shastras_, by his discourses and clear exposition.

_Upasambhasha_ (persuasions) means to appease, to conciliate, as कर्मकरानुपवदते 'he conciliates or cajoles the servants.'

_jnana_ (knowledge) means to know completely, as वदते चर्वी लोकायते 'the _charvi_ knows completely to discourse upon _Lokayat_ _shastra_.'

_Yatna_ (endeavour) means energy, as क्षेत्रे वदते 'He toils in the field,' गेहे वदते 'he toils in the house.'

_Vimati_ (disagreement) means dissension, want of unanimus opinion As क्षेत्रे विवदन्ते, 'they disagree over the field,' i.e., holding different opinions they talk diversely.

_Upamantrana_ (enticing) means to coax in secret, as, कुलभार्यामुपवदते 'he entices the wife of a respectable family (i.e., seduces her in secret),' परदारानुपवदते 'he flatters another's wife.'

Why in the above senses only? See यत् किंचिद्वदति 'he says something'.
