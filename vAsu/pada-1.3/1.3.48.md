sutra: व्यक्तवाचां समुच्चारणे
vRtti: व्यक्तवाचां समुच्चारणं सहोचारणं तत्रवर्त्तमानाद्वदतेरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _vad_, the _Atmanepada_ is employed when used in the sense of \"speaking articulately in a similar manner."

As संप्रवदन्ते ब्राह्मणाः 'the _Brahmanas_ are speaking.' But in संप्रवदन्ति कुक्कुटाः 'the cocks are crowing' it is properly _Parasmaipadi_.

The sense of the _sutra_ is that when men, who are only capable of articulate speech, speak all in one and the same time, then the verb _vad_ takes the affix of the _Atmanepada_. When lower animals make a chorus of noise, the verb does not take the _Atmanepada_

There must be _samuchcharana_ for the application of this rule; when there is no _samuchcharana_ or speaking in a chorus, this rule does not apply, as ब्राह्मणो वदति 'the _Brahmana_ speaks.'
