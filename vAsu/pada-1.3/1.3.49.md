sutra: अनोरकर्मकात्
vRtti: अनुपूर्वाद्वदतेरकर्म्मदाद्व्यक्तवाग्विषयादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _vad_, preceded by _anu_ when it is intransitively used, the _Atmanepada_ is employed, when the sense is that of 'speaking articulately in a similar manner.'

As अनुवदते कठः कलापस्य _katha_ is echoing or imitates _kalapa_. He reutters exactly what the _kalapa_-reader or the teacher says. The word _anu_ here means similarly.

Why do we say 'in the Intransitive'? Because when it is used in the transitive it takes the affixes of the _Parasmaipada_. As पूर्वमेव यजुरुदितमनुवदति, 'he repeats the _yajurveda_ which he had learned before.'

The words 'uttering of articulate speech' are understood here also. Otherwise अनुवदति वीणा 'the lute resounds,' here it is _Parasmaipada_.
