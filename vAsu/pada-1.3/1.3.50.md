sutra: विभाषा विप्रलापे
vRtti: विप्रलापात्मके व्यक्तवाचां समुच्चारणे वर्त्तमानाद्वदतेरात्मनेपदं भवति विभाषा ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _vad_, the _Atmanepada_ is employed optionally, when the sense is that of 'contradicting each other.'

---
As विप्रवदन्ते or न्ति वैद्याः (the doctors are at variance). The words _vyaktavacham_ (articulate utterance) and _samuchcharana_ (speaking together) are understood in this _sutra_ also.

No option is allowed when the sense is not that of contradiction or wrangling as, संप्रवदन्ते ब्राह्मणाः, 'the _Brahmanas_ are speaking together.'

The phrase 'articulate utterance' is necessary in this also. Because as विप्रवदन्ति शकुनयः 'the kites are quarrelling,' the verb is in the _Parasmaipada_.

The wrangling must be by talking at one and the same time, otherwise this rule will not apply. As क्रमेण वैद्या वैद्येन सह विप्रवदन्ति, 'the doctors contradict by turn another doctor.'
