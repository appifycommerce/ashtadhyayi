sutra: अवाद्ग्रः
vRtti: अवपूर्वाद् गिरतेरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _gri_ 'to swallow,' when preceded by _ava_, the _Atmanepada_ is used.
---
As अवगिरति (he swallows). The root _gri_ to swallow preceded by the preposition _ava_ is _Atmanepadi_. The verb _gri_ taken in this _sutra_ means to swallow and belongs to the _Tudadi_ class. It is not the _gri_ 'to make sound' which belongs to the _kryadi_ class, because there is no word formed with the latter verb by affixing the preposition _ava_ to it. By _sutra_ (I. .3. 78) this verb _gri_ 'to swallow' would have been _Parasmaipadi_; the present _sutra_ debars that.

When it is not preceded by _ava_, it is _Parasmaipadi_, as गिरति 'he swallows.'
