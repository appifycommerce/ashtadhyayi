sutra: समस्तृतीयायुक्तात्
vRtti: संपूर्वाच्चरतेस्तृतीयायुक्तादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _char_, preceded by _sam_, and connected with a noun in the Instrumental case, the _Atmanepada_ is employed.
---
As अश्वेन संचरते 'he rides on the horse-back.'

The rule does not apply when it is not in composition with a word in the instrumental case. As उभौ लोकौ संचरति इमं चामुं च देवल ! _O_ _Devala_! thou wanderest through both regions, this and that.' Here though the sense of the Instrumental case is implied, yet as it is not expressly stated, we use the _parasmaipada_ terminations.
