sutra: दाणश्च सा चेच्चतुर्थ्यर्थे
vRtti: दाणदाने परस्मैपदी ततः संपूर्वाद् तृतीयायुक्तादात्मनेपदं भवति साचेत् तृतीया चतुर्थ्यर्थे भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "And after the verb _da_ to give, preceded by _sam_, and connected with a noun in the Instrumental case, the _Atmanepada_ is employed, provided this Instrumental case have the sense of the Dative case."

When is the 3rd case used with the force of the 4th case? That is answered by the following.

Vart:- The Instrumental has the force of the Dative when immoral conduct is implied. As दास्या or वृषल्या संप्रयच्छते 'he gives with the object of enticing to the female slave or prostitute.'

The verb _da_ to give is generally _parasmaipadi_, it becomes _atmanepadi_ under the above conditions.

Why do we say "when it has the force of the dative case"? Because when it has not the sense of the dative, _parasmaipada_ terminations will be used, as पाणिना संप्रयच्छति, 'he gives with his hand.'

It might be asked how the _atmanepada_ terminations are employed when the preposition _sam_ is not directly applied to the verb, but another preposition _pra_, intervenes between _sam_ and the verb. The reply is that the word _samah_ in _sutra_ (I. 3. 54) is not in the ablative case (which would have required its being placed immediately before the verb), but it is in the genitive case, and is used as an attribute.
