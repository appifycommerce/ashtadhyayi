sutra: उपाद्यमः स्वकरणे
vRtti: उपपूर्वाद्यमः स्वकरणे वर्त्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _yam_, to give, preceded by _upa_, when used in the sense of "espousing," the _Atmanepada_ is employed.

This is clear. As भार्यामुपयच्छते 'he espouses or knows his wife.' But not so when another's wife is meant; there it is _parasmaipadi_.

By rule (I. 3. 78), the verb _yam_ would have been _parasmaipadi_, but the present _sutra_ makes an exception, when the root takes the preposition _upa_ and means "to marry, to espouse, or to accept." The meaning of _sva_-_karana_ is confined to accepting in general. This is according to _Kasika_; according to _Mahabhashya_, _sva_-_karana_ means to make one's own what was not previously his own.

Why do we say in the sense of "marrying"? When it has any other sense, _parasmaipada_ affixes will be employed, as देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य भार्यामुपयच्छति, _Devadatta_ has illicit intercourse with the wife of _Yajnadatta_.'
