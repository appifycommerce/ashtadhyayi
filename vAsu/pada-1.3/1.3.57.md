sutra: ज्ञाश्रुस्मृदृशां सनः
vRtti: ज्ञा श्रु स्मृ दृश् इत्येतेषां सन्नन्तानामात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the Desideratives formed by the affix _san_, of the verbs _jna_ to know, _sru_ to hear, _smri_ to remember, and _dris_ to see, the _Atmanepada_ is employed."
---
The above four roots are _atmanepadi_ when in the Desiderative form, the suffix "_san_" being the _pratyaya_ by which desideratives are formed.

The verb _jna_ takes the terminations of the _atmanepada_ when used in the senses indicated by the three _sutras_ (I. 3. 44), (I. 3. 45) and (I. 3. 46) already explained. The desiderative form of _jna_ would ex necessitate take _atmanepada_ affixes when used in the above senses: see Rule (I. 3. 62). The present _sutra_ however enlarges the scope of _atmanepada_, by declaring all desideratives of _jna_ to be _atmanepada_, in whatever sense they may be used.

Similarly by _sutra_ (I. 3. 29) _ante_ and the _vartika_ under it, the roots _sru_, and _dris_ take the terminations of the _atmanepada_; when preceded by _sam_, the desideratives of those would of course have taken _atmanepada_ affixes by (I. 3. 62), but the present _sutra_ makes it general.

The present _sutra_ however enunciates a new rule in the case of the root _smri_.

As धर्म्मं जिज्ञासते 'he wishes to know (i. e. enquires after) religion,' गुरुं शुश्रूषते 'he serves the teacher,' नष्टं सुस्मूर्षते 'he wishes to remember the lost.' नृपं दिदृक्षते 'he wishes to see the king.'

Why do we say, when taking the affix _san_? Because the primitive verbs will take the _parasmaipada_ terminations as जानाति 'he knows,' शृणोति 'he hears,' स्मरति 'he remembers' पश्यति 'he sees.'
