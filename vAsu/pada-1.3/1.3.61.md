sutra: म्रियतेर्लुङ्लिङ्गोश्च
vRtti: म्रियतेर्लुङ्लिङोः शितश्चात्मनेपदं भवति अन्यत्र न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _mri_ to die, when it has one of the affixes having an indicatory श, as well as when it takes the affixes _lun_ (aorist (III 2. 110)) add _lin_ (Benedictive (III. 3. 159)) the _Atmanepada_ is used."

This is a restrictive _sutra_, the root मृङ् (to die), is marked with a ङ् as an indicatory letter; so by _sutra_ (I. 3. 12) it would be always _Atmanepadi_. But the present aphorism restricts it to लुङ् _lun_ (Aorist) and लिङ _lin_ (Benedictive) tenses as well as to those tenses which are शित्. It will be found hereafter that out of the ten tenses, those that take शित् affixes are the special tenses, i. e., the Present, the Imperfect, the Potential and the Imperative.

It is only before these three affixes, namely, _lin_, _lun_, and _sit_ affixes, that the root _mri_ takes the terminations of the _atmanepada_. Thus the aorist अमृत _amrita_ he died; Benedictive मृषीष्ट _mrishishta_ 'may he die.' Similarly before _sit_ affixes : thus म्रियते 'he dies,' = भृ + श + ते (VII. 4. 28) रिङ् शयग्लिङ् क्षु) म्रिय + अ + ते = म्रियते (VI. 4. 77). अचि श्नुधातुभ्रुंवां य्वोरियङुवङौ) म्रियेते, म्रियन्ते The root मृ belongs to the sixth class of verbs called _Tudadi_ which take the _vikarana_ श in the conjugational tenses (III. 1. 77).

In other tenses, viz., the two Futures, the Perfect and the conditional, this verb is _parasmaipadi_. As मरिष्यति he will die. अमरिष्यत्.
