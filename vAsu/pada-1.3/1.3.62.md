sutra: पूर्ववत्सनः
vRtti: सनः पूर्वो यो धातुः आत्मनेपदी तद्वत्सन्नन्तादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The verb which is _Atmanepadi_ in its primitive form before the taking of the affix _san_, will also be _Atmanepadi_ when it ends in the affix _san_. In other words; after a desiderative verb, _Atmanepada_ is employed, if it would have been used after the primitive verb."

If the primary verb is _parasmaipadi_, its desiderative will be also _parasmaipadi_; if the primary verb is _Atmanepadi_, its desiderative will be _Atmanepadi_. This is the general rule. Some exceptions to it have already been mentioned in _sutras_ (I. 3. 57), (I. 3. 58), and (I. 3. 59). A root which was _atmanepadi_, before taking the Desiderative affix सन् _san_, will be _atmanepadi_ even when it takes the affix सन् _san_. In other words, that by reason of which the _atmanepada_ affixes were ordained in the primary verb, will cause the same terminations to be applied when the verb ends in सन् _san_. Thus it was said in _sutra_ (I. 3. 12), that roots having an _anudatta_ accented vowel as indicatory or a ङ् in as their indicatory letter take the terminations of the _atmanepada_. Thus आस्ते 'he sits down' and शेते 'he sleeps.' The verb आस् (to sit down) and शीङ् (to lie down) will remain _atmanepadi_, even when they are used as Desideratives. Thus असिसिषते 'he wishes to lie down.' Similarly _sutra_ (I. 3. 17) declared that the verb निविश् is _atmanepadi_, as निविशते. This will be _atmanepadi_ also in the Desiderative form, as निविविक्षते 'he wishes to enter.' So also by _sutra_ (I. 3. 40), आक्रमते is _atmanepadi_, the Desiderative आचिक्रंसते will also be _atmanepadi_.

But though by (I. 3. 60) and (I. 3. 61), शीयते and म्रियते are _atmanepadi_, yet शिशत्सति 'he wishes to lie down,' मुमूर्षति 'he wishes to die,' are _parasmaipadi_. Because the _atmanepada_ affixes were ordained after the roots शद and मृङ् only under exceptional conditions and not generically, and as those conditions do not exist in the desiderative, the latter does not take _atmanepada_ terminations.

Of course that which in its primary state would not have taken the terminations of the _atmanepada_, there being a prohibition to that effect, will not allow them in its Desiderative form. As अनुचिकीर्षति 'he wishes to imitate.' पराचिकीर्षति. Here the root कृञ् by rule (I. 3. 79) has been especially declared to be _parasmaipadi_, to the exclusion of _atmanepada_ affixes which would otherwise have come by Rules (I. 3. 32) and (I. 3. 72), and therefore its Desiderative is also _parasmaipadi_. The force of ञ् causing _atmanepada_ is counteracted by (I. 3. 79).

Now it might be asked :- True, this rule provides for those cases where a root is conjugated in two forms, one a Primitive and another a Desiderative conjugation. But what provision do you make for those partial verbs which take the affix सन् even in their primitive form; and in whose case we have no prior form to look upon as a guide in the application of _atmanepada_ affixes. And there are at least 7 such quasi-roots which take सन् in this way, called also the self-descriptive सन्. Those quasi-roots are गुप्, तिज्, कित्, मात्, वध, दान्, and शान्. "What are we to do with these quasi-roots, which are always conjugated with the affix सन् and have no simpler conjugation ?" To this we reply; "In the case of these partial verbs which take the self-descriptive सन् the _pada_ will be regulated by the indicatory letters which these quasi-roots have." For though the full roots are जुगुप्स, तितिक्ष, चिकित्स, मीमान्स, बीभत्स, शीशन्स and दीदान्स, yet by the maxim अवयवे कृतं लिङ्गं समुदायस्य विशेषकं भवति, "a sign made in a portion of a thing, qualifies the whole thing;" the sign made in the expression गुप् &c., will qualify the whole verb जुगुप्स &c." Thus we have जुगुप्सते he despises, चिकित्सते he cures; मीमांसते he investigates, &c.
