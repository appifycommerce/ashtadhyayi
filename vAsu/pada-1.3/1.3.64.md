sutra: प्रोपाभ्यां युजेरयज्ञपात्रेषु
vRtti: प्र उप इत्येवंपूर्वाद् युजेरयज्ञपात्रप्रयोगविषयादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _yuj_ to join the _Atmanepada_ is used, when it is preceded by _pra_ and _upa_ except with reference to sacrificial vessels even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

The verb युजिर् 'to join' is _svaritet_, and consequently by _sutra_ (1.3.72) it is always _atmanepadi_, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present _sutra_ declares when this verb may take the terminations of _atmanepada_, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. After the verb युज् preceded by the prepositions  प्र and उप the terminations are of the _atmanepada_, when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels. As प्रयुङ्क्ते 'he joins or employs'; उपयुङ्क्ते 'he fits or uses.'

Why do we say "when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels?" Because there the terminations will be of the _parasmaipada_. As द्वन्द्वं न्यञ्चि पात्राणि प्रयुनक्ति.

Vartika:- It shall be rather stated that the root takes the terminations of the _atmanepada_ when preceded by any preposition beginning or ending with a vowel. This is an important modification of the above rule. Thus उद्युङ्क्ते and नियुङ्क्ते. In fact, all _upasargas_, with the exception of सम्, निर्, and दुर्, either begin or end with a vowel, and therefore the _Vartika_ amounts to the inclusion of all prepositions with the above exception.

With सम्, निर् and दुर्, however, the root will take _parasmaipada_ terminations; as संयुनक्ति.
