sutra: समः क्ष्णुवः
vRtti: क्ष्णु तेजने परस्मैपदी ततः संपूर्वादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _kshnu_, to sharpen, preceded by _sam_, the _Atmanepada_ is employed.
---
The verb क्ष्णु 'to sharpen, whet, or grind,' is generally _parasmaipadi_, but it is _atmanepadi_, when it is preceded by the prefix सम्; as संक्ष्णुते शस्त्रम् 'he whets the weapon', संक्ष्णुवाते 'they two whet', संक्ष्णुवते 'they all whet.'

It might be objected, why has a separate aphorism been made of the verb _kshnu_, when it could well have been included in the _sutra_ (I. 3. 29) _ante_, which also speaks of the force of the prefix _sam_, when used with the verbs _gam_, _richchha_, &c. To this the answer is that, that _sutra_ treats of intransitive verbs, the word _akarmaka_ being understood therein, while the present _sutra_, as is evident from the example we have given above, treats of transitive verbs.
