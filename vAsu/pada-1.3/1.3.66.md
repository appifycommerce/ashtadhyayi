sutra: भुजोऽनवने
vRtti: भुजपालनाभ्यवहारयोरिति रुधादौ पठ्यते । तस्मादनवनेऽपालने वर्त्तमानादात्मने पदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _bhuj_, the _Atmanepada_ is used, except in the sense of protecting.

The root _bhuj_ when it does not mean to protect, is _atmanepadi_. This root belongs to the _rudhadi_ class and has several meanings, as, to feed, to cherish, to preserve, to eat, and to enjoy. As भुंक्ते 'he eats or enjoys'; also _bhunjate_, _bhunjate_ &c. But पुत्रान् भुनक्ति पिता 'the father cherishes the sons', भुनक्त्येनमग्निराहितः.

The root _bhuj_ belongs also to the _tudadi_ class, but there it has the sense of being curved or crooked. The _bhuj_ belonging to the _tudadi_ class is not to be taken in this _sutra_, because that _bhuj_ has never the sense of protecting. Therefore बिभुजति पाणिम् 'he bends the hand,' is in the _parasmaipada_.
