The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is understood in this _sutra_ and is to be supplied from the previous aphorism. This _sutra_ is also restricted to cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word हेतु in the aphorism has been defined later on in _sutra_ (I. 4. 55) (स्वतन्त्र कर्त्ता); it is the agent which is the mover of another's agent. When a fear is caused by a हेतु it is called हेतुभय. The word भय 'fear' in the aphorism is illustrative, and includes by implication विस्मय 'astonishment' also. As जटिलो भीषयते 'the _jatila_, the cock-headed frightens.' मुण्डो भीषयते 'the _munda_, the shave-headed frightens '; जटिलो विस्मापयते 'the _jatila_ astonishes,' मुण्डो विस्मापयते 'the _munda_ astonishes' i.e., the very fact of matted-hair or shaven-head frightens,' &c.

Why do we say हेतुभय? For if the fear or astonishment is not the direct result caused by the agent, but arises from something else, then the _atmanepada_ will not be used. As कुञ्चिकयैनं भाययति 'he frightens him with the _kunchika_,' रूपेण विस्माययति 'he astonishes with his form'. Here _kunchika_ and _rupa_ are the instruments, which cause fear or astonishment, and are not the _hetu_ thereof.
