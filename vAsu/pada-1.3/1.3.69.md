sutra: गृधिवञ च्योः प्रलम्भने
vRtti: गृधु अभिकाङ्क्षायाम् वञ्चु गतावित्येतयोर्ण्यन्तयोः प्रलम्भने वर्त्तमानयोरात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the causatives of the verbs _gridh_ to covet, and _vanch_ to go, the _Atmanepada_ is employed, when used in the sense of deceiving, even though the fruit of action does not accrue to the agent.
---
The phrase 'of the causatives ending in णि' is to be supplied here from _sutra_ (I. 3. 67). This _sutra_ is also restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word प्रलम्भन of the _sutra_ means deceiving. As मानवकं गर्धयते 'he deceives the boy,' मानवकं वञ्चयते 'he cheats the boy.'
+
Why do we say 'when it means deceiving,' For these verbs have not this meaning, their causatives take _parasmaipada_. As श्वानं गर्धयति 'he causes the dog to bark,' अहिं वञ्चयति 'he avoids the serpent.'
