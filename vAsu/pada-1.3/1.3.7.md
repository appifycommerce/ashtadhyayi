sutra: चुटू
vRtti: चवर्ग टवर्गौ प्रत्ययस्यादी इत्संज्ञो भवतः॥
vRtti_eng: The initial palatals and linguals of an affix are indicatory.

The consonants च्, छ्, ज्, झ्, ञ्, ट्, ठ्, ड्, ढ्, and ण्, are always इत् and are rejected when initial in affixes. The word 'affix' of the previous _sutra_ governs this also.

As the affix च्फञ् _chapan_ in _sutra_ (4.1.98) गोत्रे कुञ्जादिभ्यश्चफञ्. Here च् is indicatory, as, कौञ्चायन्यः ॥ The initial छ् _chh_ of an affix is always replaced by ईय (7.1.2) आयनेयीनीयियः फढ खच्छघां प्रत्ययादीनाम्). The initial ज् of an affix is इत्. As, जस् (Nom. Pl. term) ब्राह्मणाः ॥ The initial झ् of an affix is always replaced by अन्त, as भू + शप् + झि = भवन्ति ॥ (7.1.3) झोऽन्तः). The initial ञ् of an affix is इत् as in ञ्य which comes after the words शण्डिक &c. As शाण्डिक्यः (4.3.92) शण्डिकादिभ्योञ्यः). The indicatory ञ् causes _vriddhi_ by rules (7.2.115), (7.2.116) and (7.2.117): (अचोञ्णिति, अतउपधायाः, तद्धितेष्वचामादेः).

The initial ट् _t_ of an affix is इत् as in (3.2.16) (चरेष्टः the root चर् takes the affix ट when compounded with a noun in the locative). As कुरुचरः 'who goes among the _Kurus_.' The feminines of words formed by this affix take ङीप् (4.1.15) टिड्ढाणञ्द्वयसज् &c.) As कुरुचरी, मद्रचरी. The initial ठ् of an affix is always replaced by इक (7.3.50) ठस्येकः). The initial ड् of an office is _it_, as in (3.2.97) (सप्तम्यां जनेडः the root जन् takes the affix ड when in composition with a word in the locative, as उपसरजः, मन्दुरजः. The ड् indicates that the final of the word called टि should be elided when an affix having indicatory _d_ is added. The initial ढ् of an affix is replaced by एय (7.1.2.)

The letter ण् is always an इत् when initial. As in the aphorism (IV. 4 85) (अन्नास्मः) the affix ण comes after the word अन्न 'food.' As अन्न + ण = आन्नः. The _n_ causes _Vriddhi_.

This _sutra_ could very well have been included in the last aphorism. Why has it then been made a separate aphorism? The reply is that the present _sutra_ declares an _anitya_ rule--that is to say, a rule which is not universally true. The initial palatal or lingual of every affix is not indicatory. Thus in the affixes चुञ्चुप् and चणप् the initial च् is not indicatory but forms part of the real affix. As विद्याचुंचुः विद्याचणः 'famous for one's learning.' See _Sutra_ (5.2.26). तेन वित्तश्चुञ्चुप् चणपौ. Similarly the initial ट of the affix टीटच् (5.2.31) अवात्कुटारच्च, नते नासिकायाः संज्ञायां टीटञ् नाटज्भ्रटचः), is not _it_. As अवटीटम् 'flat nosed.'

Of course it is the initial palatal and lingual which are servile; if these letters occur in the middle of an affix, they will not be indicatory. As ठ of the affix अठच् is not indicatory in _sutra_ (5.2.35) (कर्मणि घटोऽठच्) कर्मठः 'dexterous.'
