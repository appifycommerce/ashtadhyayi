sutra: लियः संमाननशालीनीकरणयोश्च
vRtti: लियो ण्यन्तात्संमानने शालीनीकरणे च वर्त्तमानादात्मनेपदं भवति च शब्दात् प्रलम्भने च ॥
vRtti_eng:  After the causative of the verb _li_ to melt or stick, the _Atmanepada_ is employed, when used in the sense of showing respect, subduing and deceiving, even though the fruit of action does not accrue to the agent.

The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied here from _sutra_ (I. 3. 67). This _sutra_ has its scope only when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. In the _Dhatupatha_, there are two roots ली, one is technically called लीङ् and means to stick, and belongs to _divadi_ class. The other ली meaning to 'melt' belongs to _kryadi_ class. As there is no specification in the _sutra_ what ली is to be taken, both are therefore taken.

The force of the word च in the _sutra_ is to include the word प्रलम्भन 'to delude' of the last _sutra_ into the present. The word संमानन means to show respect. The word शालीनीकरण means to subdue. As जठाभिरालापयते 'he gets respect or causes respect to be shown to him through or on account of his matted hair.' श्येनो वर्तिकामुल्लापयते 'the hawk subdues the partridge', कस्त्वामुल्लापयते 'who deceives thee.'

The _sutra_ विभाषा लीयतेः (VI. 1. 51) declares that the ई of ली is optionally changed into आं before certain terminations. But there is no option allowed when the root ली has any of the above three senses : in these cases the substitution of आ is necessary and not optional. For the option allowed by _sutra_ (VI. 1. 51) is a व्यवस्थितविभाषा and not a general विभाषा applicable everywhere.

Why do we say 'when it has the meaning of 'to show respect, &c.'? Because otherwise there is _parasmaipada_. As बालकमुल्लापयति.
