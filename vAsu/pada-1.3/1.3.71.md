sutra: मिथ्योपपदात्कृञोऽभ्यासे
vRtti: ण्यन्तात् करोतेर्मिथ्योपपदादात्मनेपदं भवति अभ्यासे ॥
vRtti_eng: After the causative of the verb _kri_, the _Atmanepada_ is used, when it has the word _mithya_, incorrect, as an _upapada_ or dependent word, and is employed in the sense of 'repeated wrong utterance' even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied from _sutra_ (1.3.67). The aphorism is restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word _abhyasa_ means doing again, or repetition; as पदं मिथ्या कारयति means 'he repeatedly pronounces the word incorrectly, that is with wrong accent, &c., not once but constantly'.

Why do we say 'when the word _mithya_ is used as an _upapada_?' The causative of _kri_ will take _parasmaipada_ when it has any other _upapada_. Thus पदं सुष्टुम् कारयति 'he pronounces the word correctly.'

Why do we say 'of the verb कृञ्? Because the causative of any other verb used along with the word _mithya_ will not have _atmanepada_; as पदं मिथ्या वाचयति 'he repeatedly utters the word wrongly.' Here वच् takes _parasmaipada_.

Why do we say 'repeatedly'? For if the incorrect utterance is not habitual, then _parasmaipada_ will be used; as पदं मिथ्याकारयति 'he pronounces wrongly, not always but once.'
