sutra: अपाद्वदः
vRtti: अपपूर्वाद्वदतेः कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले आत्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _vad_ to tell, preceded by _apa_, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, the terminations are of the _Atmanepada_.

The phrase "when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent," is understood here. The _sutra_ is clear. As धनकामो न्यायमपवदते 'the wealth-seeker forsakes justice,' that is to say, he wishes to acquire wealth at the sacrifice of justice. But when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the _parasmaipada_ is employed. As अपवदति.
