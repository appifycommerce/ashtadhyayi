sutra: णिचश्च
vRtti: णिजन्तादात्मनेपदं भवति कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले ॥
vRtti_eng: After a verb ending in affix _ni_ (causal) when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, the _Atmanepada_ is employed.

The phrase "when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent" is to be supplied from _sutra_ (I.3.72). The verbs that take the affix णिच् _nich_ are generally causatives. As कटं कारयते 'he causes the mat to be made for himself'; ओदनं पाचयते 'he causes the food to be cooked for himself.' When the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the _parasmaipada_ is used. As कटं कारयति परस्य 'he causes another's mat to be made.'
