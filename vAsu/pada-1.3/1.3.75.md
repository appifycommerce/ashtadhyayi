sutra: समुदाङ्भ्यो यमो ऽग्रन्थे
vRtti: सम् उद् आङ् इत्येवं पूर्वाद्यमेः कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले आत्मनेपदं भवति ग्रन्थविषयश्चेत्प्रयोगो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _yam_ to strive, preceded by _sam_, _ut_ and _an_, when it does not refer to a book, the _Atmanepada_ is employed, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent.

The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is read into this aphorism by _anuvritti_ from _sutra_ (I.3.72). As ब्रीहीन् संयच्छते 'he gathers rice'; भारमुद्यच्छते 'he lifts up the load'; वस्त्रमायच्छते 'he draws out the cloth.' The root _yam_ preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ by virtue of aphorism (I.3.28) _ante_; but in that aphorism the verb was intransitive, here it is transitive, and this explains the necessity of making two different _sutras_ for one compound verb आयम्.

Why do we say 'when it does not refer to a book.' For otherwise the verb will take the terminations of the _parasmaipada_. As उद्यच्छति चिकित्सां वैद्यः 'the physician diligently studies medicine.'

When however the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the above compound verbs are _parasmaipadi_. As संयच्छति, उद्यच्छति, आयच्छति.
