sutra: विभाषोपपदेन प्रतीयमाने
vRtti: समीपेश्रूयमाण शब्दान्तरमुपपदं तेन प्रतीयमाने कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले विभाषाऽत्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Atmanepada_ is optionally used, when the fact of the fruit of the action accuring to the agent is indicated by an _upapada_, i.e. by a word used along with the verb.

By the preceding five _sutras_ (I. 3. 72) to (I. 3. 76), _Atmanepada_ terminations were ordained to come after verbs which implied the accrual of the fruit of the action to the agent, that is to say, where the verb by itself denoted this. But when the same idea, instead of being inherent in the verb, is expressed by an _upapada_, that is by a word governed by the verb, the necessity of using the _Atmanepada_ affixes, to denote the same idea, is obviously removed, and in such a case it is optional whether we use the _Atmanepada_ or the _Parasmaipada_ terminations. As स्वं यज्ञं यजति or यजते 'he sacrifices for his own _yajna_'; स्वं कटं करोति or कुरुते 'he makes his own cot.'; स्वं पुत्रमपवदति or अपवदते; स्वंमोदनं पाचवते or पाचयति, &c. So on with all the above five _sutras_.
