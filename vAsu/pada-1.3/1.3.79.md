sutra: अनुपराभ्यांकृञः
vRtti: अनुपरा इत्येवं पूर्वात् करोतेः परस्मैपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _kri_ to make, preceded by _anu_ and _para_, _parasmaipada_ is employed, even when the fruit of the action goes to the agent, and when the sense is that of "divulging," &c."
---
By aphorism (I. 3. 32) _ante_, the root कृ took the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ when the sense denoted was that of "divulging, reviling," &c., and it also took _Atmanepada_ termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent by virtue of _sutra_ (I. 3. 72), because the root कृञ् has an indicatory ञ. The present _sutra_ makes an exception to those rules, and ordains _parasmaipada_. Thus अनुकरोति 'he imitates,' पराकरोति 'he does well.'
