sutra: अभिप्रत्ययिभ्यः क्षिपः
vRtti: अभिप्रति अतिइत्येवं पूर्वात् क्षिपः परस्मैपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _kship_, to throw, coming after _abhi_, _prati_ and _ati_, _parasmaipada_ is used, even though the fruit of the action goes to the agent."
---
The root क्षिप् to throw, is _svariteta_ therefore by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72) _ante_, it would have taken _Atmanepada_ termination, when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent; this aphorism ordains _parasmaipada_ instead. As अभिक्षिपति 'he throws on,' प्रतिक्षिपति 'he turns away or rejects,' अतिक्षिपति 'he throws beyond.'

Why do we say 'when coming after _abhi_, _prati_, and _ati_'? Because when compounded with any other preposition, it will not take _parasmaipada_, but will be governed by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72). As आक्षिपते 'he throws down.'

The second कर्तृ of _sutra_ (I. 3. 14) is also understood here, so that when the verb is used reflexively, the agent not being purely an agent, the present _sutra_ will not apply. As अभिक्षिप्यते स्वयमेव 'it is thrown on of itself.'
