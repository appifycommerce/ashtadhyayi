sutra: प्राद्वह
vRtti: प्र पूर्वाद् वहतेः परस्मैपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _vah_ to bear, coming after _pra_, _parasmaipada_ is used, even though the fruit of the action accrues to the agent.

---
The root वह to carry is _svaritet_, and by _sutra_ (I.3.72) it would have taken the _Atmanepada_ termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. But the present _sutra_ ordains _parasmaipada_ instead. As प्रवहति 'it flows.'

Why do we say "when coming after _pra_"? Because after any other preposition it will not take _parasmaipada_, as आवहते 'he brings.'
