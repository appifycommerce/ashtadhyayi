sutra: परेर्मृषः
vRtti: परिपूर्वाद् मृष्यतेः परस्मैपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _mrish_ to bear, preceded by _pari_, _parasmaipada_ is used, even when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent.

---
The root मृष "to suffer" is _svaritet_, and by _sutra_ (I.3.72) it would have taken _Atmanepada_ termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. This ordains _parasmaipada_ instead. As परमृष्यति 'he endures or he becomes angry.' When not preceded by this preposition, it takes _Atmanepada_ termination. As आमृष्यते.

According to some authors, the root वह of the last aphorism is said to be understood in this, so that वह preceded by परि will also take _parasmaipada_ terminations; as परिवहति
