sutra: उपाच्च
vRtti: उपपूर्वाद्रमतेः परस्मैपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And also after _upa_, the verb _ram_ takes the affixes of the _parasmaipada_.

As देवदत्तमुपरमति 'he causes _Devadatta_ to refrain.' The sense of the verb _uparamati_ is causative here, as if it was उपरमयति. This is an example of a verb involving in it the force of the causative affix णिच्.

It might be asked why was not the preposition उप read along with the other preposition in the last aphorism, instead of making this a separate _sutra_. The answer is that the necessity of making a separate _sutra_ with the preposition _upa_ arose from the exigencies of _sutra_ making. It is desired, that the next _sutra_ (1.3.85) should apply only to the root _upa_-_ram_, and not to other compounds of _ram_; and this could only be done by making these two distinct _sutras.
