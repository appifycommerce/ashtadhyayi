sutra: निगरणचलनार्थेभ्यश्च
vRtti: निगरणार्थेभ्यश्च चलनार्थेभ्यश्च धातुभ्योण्यन्तेभ्यः परस्मैपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "And after the causatives of verbs which have the sense of the 'eating or swallowing' and 'shaking or moving' _parasmaipada_ is employed, even when the fruit of the action goes to the agent."

The phrase 'when used in the causative (णेः) of the last _sutra_ is to be read into this also. The _parasmaipada_ is ordained as an exception to _sutra_ (I. 3. 74) by which _atmanepada_ was ordained when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. The word निगरणं means 'eating,' and चलनं means 'moving,' 'shaking.' As निगारयति he causes to swallow; आशयति he causes to eat; भोजयति he feasts; चलयति he moves; चोपयति, कम्पयति he shakens. This aphorism applies to transitive verbs, and to verbs whose agents in non-causative state are inanimate objects, i. e. not possessed with reason.

Vart:- The prohibition of the root अद to eat, must be mentioned. The causative of अद to eat, takes _atmanepada_. Thus अत्ति देवदत्तः _Devadatta_ eats; आदयते देवदत्तेन he is made to eat by _Devadatta_.
