sutra: न पादम्याङ्यमाङ्यसपरिमुहरुचिनृतिवदवसः
vRtti: पादमि आङ्यम आङ्यस परिमुह रुचि नृति वदवसः इत्येतेभ्योण्यन्तेभ्यः परस्मैपदं न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: But the affixes of the _parasmaipada_ are not used after the causals of the verbs _pa_ to drink, _dam_ to tame, _ayam_ to extend, _ayas_ to exert oneself, _parimuh_ to be bewildered, _ruch_ to shine, _nrit_ to dance, _vad_ to speak, and _vas_ to dwell.

The last two aphorisms had ordained _parasmaipada_ instead of _Atmanepada_, even when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent, thus debarring the latter's action which would otherwise have taken place by virtue of _sutra_ (I. 3. 74). This _sutra_ prohibits the last two _sutras_, and re-instates _Atmanepada_ of _sutra_ (I. 3. 74). Thus root पा to drink, has the sense of _nigarana_ or swallowing, the roots दम &c., have sentient beings as their agent; the root नृत् to dance has the sense of चलन or moving, but still these verbs have _atmanepada_ affixes, and do not take _parasmaipada_ in the causative. As पाययते he causes to drink, दमयते he causes to be tame, आयामयते he lengthens, आयासयते he troubles, परिमोहयते he entices, रोचयते he makes agreeable, नर्त्तयते he causes to dance, वादयते he makes to speak, वासयते he causes to dwell.

Vart:- The root धेट is should be enumerated along with पा &c. Thus धापयेते शिशुमेक समीची. The doe suckles a young infant.
