sutra: तस्य लोपः
vRtti: तस्येत्संज्ञकस्य लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Of this, (namely of that which has been called इत्), there is elision.

---
This _sutra_ declares the function of इत्; namely it is a mere indicatory letter, and must be rejected. It is useful only as a mnemonic and is not a part of the term.

The word _tasya_ in the _sutra_ indicates that the substitution of _lopa_ must be in the place of the whole term called इत्, and not only in the place of the final letter, which last is the general rule (see. (I.1.52)). Therefore, the whole of ञि, टु  and डु is rejected and not only their finals.
