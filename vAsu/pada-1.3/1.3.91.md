The _Dyutadi_ verbs are 22 in number, to be found in _Dhatupatha_ in the _Bhuadi_ class. By the use of the word द्युद्भ्यः in the plural in the _sutra_, the force is that of &c. These verbs are _anudatta_ and so by _sutra_ (I.3.12) they would have been invariably _atmanepadi_, this aphorism makes them optionally so in the aorist. Thus अद्युतत् or अद्योतिष्ठ he shone. In other tenses than the aorist (लुङ्) these verbs are invariably _Atmanepadi_. As द्योतते he shines.
