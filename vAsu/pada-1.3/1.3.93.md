sutra: लुटिचक्लृपः
vRtti: लुटि च स्यसनोश्च कृपे परस्मैपदं वा भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the verb _klip_ to be fit, _Parasmaipada_ is optionally employed, when _lut_ (Ist Future) is affixed, as well as when _sya_ and _san_ are affixed."
---
The verb क्लप् is one of the five verbs of the sub-class वृतादि of the last aphorism. Therefore it will take both _parasmaipada_ and _Atmanepada_, when the affixes स्य or सन follow. The present _sutra_ makes the additional declaration in the case of Ist Future or लुट. Thus in _Lut_ we have-- कल्प्तसि or कल्प्तासे thou wilt be; in Ist Future we have :- कल्पिष्यते or कल्प्स्यति he will be; in the Desiderative we have :- चिक्लृप्सति or चिकल्पिषते; in the conditional we have :- अकल्प्स्यत् or अकाल्पष्यत.
