sutra: हृस्वं लघु
vRtti: हृस्वमक्षरं लघुसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A short vowel is called 'light' (_laghu_).

This defines the word _Laghu_. A _hrasva_ vowel which has already been defined (I. 2. 27), is under certain circumstances called _laghu_ or 'light'; thus the _i_ of भिद to break, is _laghu_, and by being _laghu_ it is _gunated_ before the affix ता + आ, as भेत्ता he will break, by virtue of the rule (VII 3. 86), which declares that a _laghu_ penultimate vowel is _gunated_ before a _Sarvadhatuka_ or an _ardhadhatuka_ affix. So also छेत्ता, अचीकरत् and अजीहरत्.
