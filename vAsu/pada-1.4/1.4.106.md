vRtti: प्रहासे गम्यमाने मन्योपपदे धातोर्मध्यमपुरुषो भवति, मन्यतेश्चोत्तमः स चैकवद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When joke is implied with reference to an action, the verb denoting it is used in the 2nd person; provided that the word _manya_ \"to think\" is the attendant word (_upapada_) of such verb, and of the verb _manya_ itself, the affix must be of the 1st person and singular number.

The word प्रहास means joke, sport. As एवं मन्ये ओदनं भोक्ष्यसे इति; नहि भोक्ष्यसे, भुक्तः सोऽतिथिमिः. Thus thou thinkest 'I shall eat rice,' thou shalt not eat, that has been eaten by a guest. एहि मन्ये रथेन यास्यसि नहि यास्यसि, यातस्तेन ते पिता. I think thou wilt go by the chariot, no, thou wilt not, thy father has gone before thee on it. When joke is not intended, the proper persons should be used: as, एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये. Thus thou thinkest 'I shall eat rice.'
