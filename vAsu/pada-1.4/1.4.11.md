sutra: संयोगेगुरु
vRtti: संयोगे परतो हृस्वमक्षरं गुरुसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When a conjunct consonant follows, a short vowel is termed \"heavy\" (_Guru_).

A _hrasva_ vowel however is not to be called 'light' when it is followed by a conjunct consonant. As the _i_ of शिक्षा 'learning' is a heavy vowel. Thus शिक्षा is derived from शिक्ष + अ (III. 3. 103), (let the affix अ come after that verb which has a heavy vowel and ends in a consonant when the word to be formed is feminine). So also कुण्डा and भिक्षा.
