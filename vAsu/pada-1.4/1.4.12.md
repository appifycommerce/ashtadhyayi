This is clear the _anuvritti_ of the word conjunct is not understood in this _sutra_. As _i_ of ईहांचक्रे he endeavoured, ईक्षांचक्रे he saw. Here the letter ई is _guru_, and because of its being called _guru_, the rule (III.1.36) is applied in forming the perfect tense by the addition of the augment आस्. Thus all long vowels, and short vowels followed by conjunct consonants are _guru_ or heavy. All other short vowels are _laghu_.
