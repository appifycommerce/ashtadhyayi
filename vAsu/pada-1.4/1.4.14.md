sutra: सुप्तिङन्तं पदम्
vRtti: सुबन्तं तिङन्तं च शब्दरूपं पदसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "That which ends in _sup_ (case-affix) (IV. 1. 2); or in _tin_ (III. 4. 78) (tense-affix), is called a _pada_ or inflected word."

The _sup_ or case-affixes are those by which nouns are declined; and _tin_ are tense-affixes by which verbs are conjugated. They have already been given before. Thus ब्राह्मण + जस् = ब्राह्मणाः the _Brahmanas_ पचन्ति they cook.

It might be asked by a caviller why the word अन्त has been used in the aphorism, for by the rule of _tadanta_ given in _Sutra_ (I. 1. 72) a rule relating to _sup_ will mean and include also that which ended with a _sup_-affix. To this we reply, that the very fact that the word _anta_ is used in this _sutra_, indicates by implication (_jnapaka_) that the _Tadanta_ rule of _Sutra_ 72 Chapter I does not apply to rules of _sanjna_ (definition) made with regard to affixes. Thus _tarap_ and _tamap_ affixes are called _gha_ by _Sutra_ (I. 1. 22). The _tadanta_-_vidhi_ will not apply here; words ending with these affixes will not be called _gha_. Thus ब्राह्मणितरा will not be called _gha_, for had it been so called, the long ई will be shortened in गौरी ब्राह्मणितरा. In short, 'an affix when employed in a rule which teaches the meaning of a technical term (_sanjna_) does not denote a word-form ending with the affix.'
