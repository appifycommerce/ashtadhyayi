sutra: नः क्ये
vRtti: नान्तं शब्दरूपं क्ये परतः पदसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word-form ending in _n_, is called _pada_, when _kya_ follows (i.e., the affixes _kyach_, _kyan_ and _kyash_).

These are affixes by which denominative verbs are formed from nouns. See (III.1.8), (III.1.11), and (III.1.13). A word ending in न is called _pada_, when these affixes follow. Thus राजन् + क्यच् = राजीय 3rd Per. 8. राजीयति he behaves like a king. So also राजन् + क्यङ् = राजायते (VII.4.5.) चर्मन् + क्यष् = चर्मायते or चर्मायति. The result of its being called _pada_ is that the न् of राजन्, चर्मन् &c., is elided by _Sutra_ (VIII.2.7). (there is elision of न् final in a _pada_ which is entitled to the designation of _pratipadika_). Thus राजन् + क्यच् = राज + य = राजीय (VII.4.33).

These three affixes क्यच् &c., come after case-inflected words (i.e., words ending in _sup_), and though, before these affixes, the case terminations are elided, still by _Sutra_ (I.1.62) such words would have retained the name of _pada_ which they got by Rule 14 of this Chapter. The present _sutra_ however makes a restriction (_niyama_). It declares that only words ending in न् retain the name of _pada_; while all other case-inflected words before these affixes do not retain that designation. Thus the words वाच् speech, स्रुच् a ladle are not treated as _pada_ and we have वाच्यते and स्रुच्यते. Had they been _pada_, the च् would have been changed into क् by (VIII.2.30).
