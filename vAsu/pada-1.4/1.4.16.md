sutra: सिति च
vRtti: सिति प्रत्यये परतः पूर्वं पदसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When an affix having an indicatory स् follows then that which precedes it is called _pada_.

The sutra 18 of this chapter teaches that before certain affixes, the preceding word is called _bha_. This _sutra_ declares an exception to that by anticipation. Thus Rule (4.2.115) declares: -- "Affixes ठक् and छस् come after the _vriddha_ (1.1.74) word भवत्." Here the affix छस् has an indicatory स्, therefore the word भवत्, standing before it, will be called _pada_. Thus भवत् + छस् = भवदीयः (7.1.2), belonging to you. The result of being _pada_ is that ते is changed into द (VIII 2. 39). Similarly स् is इत् in युस् (After the word _urna_ there is _yus_ (V. 2 123). Thus ऊर्णायुः; so also घस् (5.1.106), has स् as indicatory. Thus ॠत्वियः There is no _guna_ because of its being _pada_
