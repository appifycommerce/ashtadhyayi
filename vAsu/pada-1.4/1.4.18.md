sutra: यचि भम्
vRtti: यकारादाधजादौ च स्वादौ सर्वनामस्थानवर्जिते प्रत्यये परतः पूर्वं भसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And when an affix, with an initial _y_ or an initial vowel, being one of the affixes, beginning with _su_ and ending in _k_, follows, not being _Sarvanamasthana_, then what precedes, is called _Bha_.

This debars the application of _pada_. Thus गर्ग + यञ् (IV. 1. 105) = गार्ग्यः a grandson of _Garga_. So also वात्स्यः. The affix _yan_ begins with a _ya_ and the word _garga_ being treated as _Bha_ its final अ is elided before the affix by (VI. 4. 148).

So also दक्ष + इञ् = दाक्षिः (IV. 1. 95) grandson of _Daksha_ प्लाक्षिः. Here the affix इञ् begins with a vowel the word standing before it being _Bha_, it causes elision of the final अ of _daksha_.

The word यचि is in the 7th case meaning when य् or अच् follow; and by the last _Vart_ of _Sutra_ (I. 1. 72), it means 'when an affix beginning with _ya_ or _ach_ follow.'

Vart:- The words नभस्, अङ्गिरस् and मनुष् should be treated as _Bha_ when the affix वत् follows. Thus नभस्वत् like the sky. अङ्गिरस् like the _Angiras_. मनुष्वत् like the man. By being _Bha_, the स् is not changed into र्, which it would have been, had it been a _pada_ (VIII. 2. 66).

Vart:- The words वृषन् is treated as _Bha_ in the vedas when the words वसु and अश्व follow. Thus वृषण्वसुः; वृषणश्वस्य मेने Here had the word _vrishan_ been treated as _pada_, the न would not have been changed into ण (See Rule (VIII. 4. 37)); and this न would have been dropped before the affix _vasu_ by (VIII. 2. 7).
