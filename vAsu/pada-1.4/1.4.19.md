sutra: तसौ मत्वर्थे
vRtti: तकारान्तं सकारान्तं शब्दरूपं मत्वर्थे प्रत्यये परतो भसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word-form ending in _t_ or in _s_ is called _Bha_ when an affix with the force of _matup_ ('whose is it,' 'or in whom it is' (V. 2. 94)) follows.

The word _Bha_ is understood in this _sutra_. Thus is the word उदश्वित्वत् having butter milk Nom. Sing. उदश्वित्वान् पोषः the herdsman having butter milk, विद्युत्वान् बलाहकः the cloud full of thunder. So also यशस्वी famous; पयस्वी full of milk. Thus उदश्वित् + वतुप् = उदश्वित्वत्, यशस् + विनि (V.2.121) = यशस्विन्. By making these _Bha_, the operation of _pada_ rule is debarred in their case. That is to say the त of _udasvit_ &c., and the स् of _yasas_ &c., are not changed into द and र respectively, which had they been _pada_ words would have been the case by the action of _Sutra_ (VIII.2.39), and (VIII.2.66). viz., उदश्विद्वत् and यशोविन् which are incorrect.
