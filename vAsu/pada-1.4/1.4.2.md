sutra: विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यम्
vRtti: (तुल्यबलविरोधो विप्रतिषेधः) तस्मिन् विप्रतिषेधे परंकार्यम् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When rules of equal force prohibit each other, then the last in the order herein given is to take effect.

The word विप्रतिषेधे means 'opposition of rules of equal force.' When two topics having different objects in view find scope of action simultaneously in one particular case, that opposition of equal forces is called _vipratishedha_. A general rule (_utsarga_) and its exception (_upavada_), or an invariable (_nitya_) and an optional (_anitya_) rule, or an _antaranga_ and a _bahiranga_ rule, are not rules of equal force. There the stronger prevails against the weaker. As an example of rules of equal force, see (7.3.102.) and (7.3.103). The first rule declares, 'when a case-affix beginning with a letter of _yan_ _pratyahara_ follows, the long vowel is substituted for the final of an inflective base ending in a short अ.' As _Vriksha_ + _bhyam_ = _Vrikshabhyam_. The next rule declares :- When a plural case-affix beginning with a letter or _jhal_ _pratyahara_ follows, ए is the substitute for the final short अ of an inflective base.' As _Vriksha_ + _su_ = _Vriksheshu_. But when the plural case-affix _bhyah_ follows, what rule are we to apply? For the letter _bha_ belongs both to the _pratyaharas_ _yan_ and _jhal_. Are we to lengthen the short अ, or substitute ए? The present _sutra_ gives the reply, ए is to be substituted because (7.3.103) ordaining ए follows next to (7.3.102). Thus _Vriksha_ + _bhyah_ = _Vrikshebyah_.
