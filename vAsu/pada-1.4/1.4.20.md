sutra: अयस्मयादीनि च्छन्दसि
vRtti: अयस्मयादीनि शब्दरूपाणि च्छन्दसि विषये साधूनि भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: Words like _ayasmaya_ &c., are valid forms in the _chhandas_ (_veda_).

These words being taught here in the topic relating to _pada_ and _Bha_, show that they have been properly forced in the _chhandas_ by the application of the rules of _Bha_ and _pada_. Thus अयस् + मय = अयस्मय made of iron. Here the word अयस् is treated as _Bha_ and hence the स् is not changed into र. Thus अयस्मयं वर्म iron-made coat of mail. अयस्मयानि पात्राणि iron vessels. The present form of this word is अयोमयं. In some places both these _pada_ and _Bha_ apply simultaneously. Thus in the word ॠक्वत् formed by ऋच् + वत्, the च् is first changed into क् by treating the word rich as a _pada_. Then the word ॠक् is treated as _Bha_, and therefore the क् is not changed into ग् before वत्. For had it been _pada_, the form would have been ॠग्वत् _Rigvat_. These irregularly formed words occur only in the _chhandas_ or Vedic literature. Thus स सुष्टुभास ऋक्वता गणेन.
