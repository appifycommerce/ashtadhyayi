sutra: द्येकयो द्विर्ववचनैकवचने
vRtti: द्वित्वैकत्वयोरर्थयोर्द्विवचनैकवचने भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The dual and singular case-affixes are employed severally in the sense of duality and unity.
---
This is also clear. When duality is to be expressed, a dual case-affix should be employed, and in the case of unit, the singular case-affix. Thus ब्राह्मणौ पचतः the two _Brahmins_ cook. ब्राह्मणः पचति the _Brahmin_ cooks.
