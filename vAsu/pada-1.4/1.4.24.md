sutra: ध्रुवमपायेऽपादानम्
vRtti: ध्रुवं यदपाययुक्त नपाये साध्ये यदवधिभूतं तत्कारकमपादानसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "A noun whose relation to an action is that of a fixed point from which departure takes place is called _apadana_ or Tablation."
---
This defines the Ablation or _Apadana_ _karaka_. Thus ग्रामादागच्छति he comes from the village. पर्वतादवरोहति he descends from the mountain. स्वार्थाद्धीनः lost his object. रथात् पतितः fallen from the chariot. The _Apadana_ takes the 5th case-affix (II. 3 28) and the above examples show this. When therefore this relation is to be expressed, 'the fixed point (like _grama_, _purvata_ &c., in the above) which is the limit denoted by a word dependent on a verb, is called ablation.'

Vart:- The objects of verbs denoting 'aversion,' 'cessation' and 'negligence' are also called ablation. Thus:- अधर्माञ्जुगुप्सते he dislikes injustice; अधर्माद्विरमति he ceases from injustice. धर्मात्प्रमाद्यति he neglects justice.
