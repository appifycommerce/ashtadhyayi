sutra: अन्तर्द्धौ येनादर्शन मिछति
vRtti: अन्तर्द्धिनिमित्तं येनादर्शनमात्मनइच्छतितत्कारकमपादानसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "When concealment is indicated, the person whose sight one wishes to avoid, is called _Apadana_ _karaka_."

Thus उपाध्यायादन्तर्धत्ते or निलीयते he conceals or hides from the teacher; so that the teacher may not find him out or see him.

Why do we say 'when concealment is indicated'? Observe चौरात् न दिदृक्षते he does not wish to see the thieves. Here the term _chauran_ is in the accusative case.

Why has the word _ichchhati_ been used in the text? The _apadana_ _karaka_ is to be used there only, where one desires that he should not be seen, yet he shows himself.
