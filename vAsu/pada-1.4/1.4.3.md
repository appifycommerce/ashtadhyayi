sutra: यूस्त्र्याख्यौ नदी
vRtti: ईकारान्तमूकारान्तं च स्त्र्याख्यं शब्दरूपं नदी संज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Word-forms ending in long _i_ and _u_ being names of females are called _Nadi_.
---
The word यू is compound of ई + ऊ The word _stryakhya_ means that which by itself denotes the name of a female. These words must be always feminine, having no masculine of the same form, as the word _gramani_ has. As the words _Kumari_ a virgin, यवागू, _yavaguh_ rice gruel. The declension of nouns of _nadi_ class is somewhat peculiar which will be treated of later. As see Rule (VII. 3. 112) आट् is the augment of the case-affixes having an indicatory ङ when they come after a word ending with a _Nadi_.

Why do we say ending in ई and ऊ ? Because feminine nouns not ending in these vowels will not be declined like _Nadi_ words. Thus while the dative of कुमारी will be कुमार्य्यै, the dative of दुहितृ will be दुहित्रे.

Why do we say 'which are feminine'? Because if they are names of males, they will not be called _Nadi_. As ग्रामणीः leader of a village; सेनानी leader of an army; खलपू a sweeper; their dative being ग्रामण्ये, सेनान्ये, खलप्ये.

Why have we used the word _akhya_ 'name' in the text? Because feminine gender must be denoted by the word itself and not by any other epithet used along with the word. Thus if the head-borough or the sweeper should be of the female sex, the Dative Singular would still be ग्रामण्ये स्त्रियै and खलप्वे स्त्रियै.
