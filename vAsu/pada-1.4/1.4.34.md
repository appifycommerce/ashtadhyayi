sutra: श्लाघुन्हुङ्स्थाशपां ज्ञीप्स्यमानः
vRtti: श्लाघ न्हुङ् स्था शप् इत्येतेषां ज्ञीप्स्यमानो योऽर्थ स्तत् कारकं संप्रदानसंज्ञं भवति ॥

The word ज्ञीप्स्यमान means whom it is desired to make known or inform. As देवदत्ताय श्लाघते he praises _Devadatta_, i.e., while praising _Devadatta_, he wishes that he should know this praise. So also with other verbs. As देवदत्ताय ह्नुते he hides from (wishing that _Devadatta_ should know of it) _Devadatta_, देवदत्ताय तिष्ठते she offers herself to _Devadatta_ (for sexual embrace, wishing that he should know of it). देवदत्ताय शपते he reviles _Devadatta_.

Why do we say 'the person whom it is intended to inform'? Observe देवदत्ताय श्लाघति पथि. Here _pathi_ is in the Locative case.
