sutra: क्रुधद्रुहेर्ष्या सूयार्थानां यं प्रतिकोपः
vRtti: क्रुधाद्यर्थानां प्रयोगे यं प्रतिकोपस्तत्कारकं संप्रदानसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the case of the verbs having the sense of _krudh_ to be angry, _druh_ to injure, _irshya_ to envy, _asuya_ to detract, the person against whom the feeling of anger &c., is directed is called _Sampradana_.

_Krudh_ means non-tolerance, _droha_ means doing wrong or hurt, _irshya_ jealousy; and _asuya_ means to find out the faults of another. The word _kopa_ includes all the above four sorts of actions. As देवदत्ताय क्रुध्यति-द्रुह्यति-ईर्ष्यति or असूयति he is angry upon, (i. e. with) or bears malice to, or is jealous of, or finds out the faults of _Devadatta_. Here _Devadatta_ is in the Dative case.

Why do we say 'against whom the feeling of anger is directed.' Be if there be no feeling of anger, then these verbs will not govern the dative case, but the accusative. Thus भार्यामीर्ष्यति he is jealous of his wife, i.e., does not wish her to be seen by others. Here the word _bharya_ is in the accusative case.
