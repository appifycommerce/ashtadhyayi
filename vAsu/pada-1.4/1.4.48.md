As ग्राममुपवसति सेना the army dwells in the village पर्वतमुपवसति-अनुवसति अधिवसति or आवसति.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated when the verb वस् means "fasting," or does not denote lying in a locality. As ग्रामे उपवसति he fasts in the village. Here the verb _upavasati_ governs the locative case and not the accusative.
