sutra: तथा युक्तं चानीप्सितम्
vRtti: येन प्रकारेण कर्त्तु रीप्सिततमं क्रियया युज्यते तेनैव चेत् प्रकारेण यदनीप्सितं युक्तं भवति तस्य कर्मसंज्ञा विधीयते ॥
vRtti_eng: "If that which is not intended to be most affected by the act becomes however similarly connected with the action it also is called _karma_."

That which is not desired by the agent is _anipsita_ or object of aversion. Thus विषं भक्षयति he eats poison, चोरात् पश्यति. He sees the thieves. ग्रामम् गच्छन् वृक्षमूला न्युपसर्पति going to the village, he plucks the roots of the trees.
