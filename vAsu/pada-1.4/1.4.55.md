sutra: तत् प्रयोजको हेतुश्च
vRtti: स्वतन्त्रस्य प्रयोजको योऽर्थः तत्कारकं हेतुसंज्ञं भवति चकारात् कर्तृसंज्ञं च ॥
vRtti_eng: That which is the mover thereof, i. e., of the independent source of action, is called _Hetu_ or cause, as well as _karta_ or agent

---
Thus कारयति he causes to be made, हारयति he causes to be taken. When _hetu_ is employed as agent the verb is put in the causative form (III.1.26).

The force of the word च is to give both names to the mover of an agent, viz., _Hetu_ and _karta_: otherwise by _sutra_ 1 of this Chapter only one name would have been given.
