sutra: प्रादयः
vRtti: प्रादयो ऽसत्वे निपातसंज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The words _pra_ &c., are called _Nipata_ when not signifying substances."
---
The following is the list of प्रादयः or 'prepositions:' प्र, परा, अव, सम्, अनु, अव, निस्, दुस्, वि, आङ्, नि, अधि, अपि, अति, सु, उत्, अभि, प्रति, परि, उप ॥

The making of this a distinct aphorism, when it could well have been included in the last, is for the sake of giving the _Pra_ &c., words two names, namely, those of _Nipatas_, as well as _upasargas_ under certain circumstances, i.e., when they are in composition with verbs. Not so however the _cha_ &c., words. They never get the designation of _upasargas_.

When these words signifying substances they are not _Nipatas_. As परा जयति सेना the excellent army conquers. Here the word परा is not a _Nipata_.
