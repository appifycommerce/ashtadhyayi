sutra: उपसर्गाः क्रियायोगे
vRtti: प्रादयः क्रिया योगे उपसर्ग संज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The words _pra_ &c., get the designation of _upasarga_ or prepositions, when in composition with a verb.

---
As प्र + नयति = प्रणयति. Here the dental न is changed into cerebral ण, because of the प्र getting the designation of _upasarga_ (See _sutra_ (8.4.14)). Similarly परिणयति, प्रणायकः, परिणायकः.

Why do we say when in composition with a verb? When in composition with a noun they are not called _upasargas_. As प्रगतो नायकोऽस्माद् देशात् = प्रनायकोदेशः a country destitute of a leader. Here न is not changed into ण. Thus while प्रणायकः means 'a leader' the term प्रनायकः means destitute of a leader; though both have the same radical elements :-- _pra_ in one is an _upasarga_, in the other a _Nipata_ pure and simple.

Vart:- The word मरुत् should be included in the list of _upasargas_. As मरुद्भिर्दत्तः = मरुत्तः given by _Marut_. मरुत् + दा + क्त = मरुत् + त् + त (7.4.47). Here _Marut_ being treated as an _upasarga_, though it does not end with a vowel, the दा is replaced by त by rule (7.4.47) which declares 'त the substitute of दा which is called _ghu_ when it is preceded by an _upasarga_ that ends in a vowel, and is followed by an affix beginning with त which has an indicatory _k_.'

It might be objected, that as मरुत् does not end with a vowel, _sutra_ (7.4.47) does not apply. To this we say that otherwise the giving the designation of _upasarga_ to मरुत् is superfluous; and in order that this should not be so, the fact of its not ending with a vowel is overlooked.

Vart:- The particle श्रत् should be included in the list of _upasargas_. Thus श्रत् + धा + अङ् = श्रद्धा (3.3.106). Here because श्रत् is treated as an _upasarga_, that _sutra_ (3.3.106) is made applicable.
