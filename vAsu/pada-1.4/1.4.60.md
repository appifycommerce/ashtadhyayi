sutra: गतिश्च
vRtti: गतिसंज्ञकाश्च प्रादयो भवन्ति क्रियायोगे ॥
vRtti_eng: The words _pra_ &c., are called also _Gati_, when in composition with a verb.

As प्रकृत्य, Now the gerund of the simple root कृ would have been कृत्वा, but as it is compounded with a _gati_ word (2.2.18) the त्वा is replaced by ल्यप् see (2.2.18) and (VII. 1 37). प्र + कृ + ल्यप् = प्रकृत्या (6.1.71). Here _pra_ being called _gati_ we have compounding by rule (2.2.18); and then we apply (7.1.37). Similarly प्रकृतम्. Here _pra_ being a _gati_ word retains its own accent by rule (6.2.49). 'a _gati_ retains in a compound its own accent when it immediately precedes a second member that ends in _kta_, provided the latter denotes the object of the action which is expressed by the root to which _kta_ is added.'

Similarly प्रकरोति, here _pra_ being treated as _gati_ gets _anudatta_ accent by rule (8.2.71),

The _yoga_-_vibhaga_ or the separation of one aphorism into two, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms. The _anuvritti_ of _gati_ only runs through the latter _sutras_ and not of _upasarga_. So that while _pra_ &c., have two names _upasarga_ and _gati_; _uri_ &c., have only one name, namely, _gati_.

Thus in प्रणीतम् and अभिषि॑क्तम्, by treating the words अ and अभि as _upasargas_ we change the न and स into ण and ष by rule (8.4.14) and (8.3.87); and again treating them as _gati_ we regulate the accent.

Vart:- The words कारिका should be included in the list of _Gati_. As (1) कारिकाकृत्य (2) कारिकाकृतम् (3) यत्कारिका करोति. In the first by taking it as _gati_ we have _samasa_ (2.2.18) and ल्यप् (7.1.37) The other two cases illustrate accent.

Vart:- The words पुनर् and चनस् are treated as _Gati_ in the _Vedas_. As पुनरुत्स्यूतंवासो देयम्. Here the word पुनर् being _gati_, causes स्यूतं to take _anudatta_ accent (8.1.70) चनोहितः. Here also the accent is regulated by (8.2.71).
