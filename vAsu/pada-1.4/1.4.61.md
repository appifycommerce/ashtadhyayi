sutra: ऊर्यादि च्विडाचश्च
vRtti: ऊर्यादयः शब्दाः च्व्यन्ता डाजन्ताश्च क्रियायोगे गतिसंज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The words _uri_, assent, &c., and those that end with _chvi_ (V. 4. 50), and those that end with _dach_ (V. 4. 57), (when in composition with the verb _bhu_, _kri_ or _as_) are called _Gati_."
---
The affixes _chvi_ and _dach_ are ordained when the verb in composition is either कृ, भू or अस् (V. 4. 50) and (V. 4. 57) _uri_ &c., being read along with _chvi_ and _dach_, shows that the verb in composition with them must also be any one of the above three verbs, and none else; in order to entitle ऊरी to the name of _gati_.

The words ऊरी and उररी mean to assent and spread. As ऊरीकृत्य (II. 2. 18) and (VII. 1. 37) ऊरीकृतम् (VI. 2. 49), यदूरीकरोति (VIII. 2. 71). So with the word उररी. The following is a list of these words :-

- पापी. धूसी. भ्रंशकला. फली.
- ताली. शकला. गुलुगुधा. विल्फी.
- आताली. संशकला. सजूः आल्की.
- वेताली. ध्वंसकला. फलू.

The words ending in _chvi_ are also _gati_. As शुक्लीकृत्य having made white what was not white.

So also words ending in डाच् as पटपटाकृत्य having made the sound _pat_.
