The word अलम् is an indeclinable and has four meanings :- 'prohibition, competent, enough and ornament.' The term अलम् is _gati_ when it means ornament.
As अलंकृत्य (II.2.18), (VII.1.37); अलंकृतं (VI.2.49) यदलंकरोति (VIII.2.71) when it does not mean ornament we have अलं भुक्त्वा व्रजति he goes having eaten enough.
