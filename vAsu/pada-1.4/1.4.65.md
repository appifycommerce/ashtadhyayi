sutra: अन्तरपरिग्रहे
vRtti: अन्तः शब्दोऽपरिग्रहेऽर्थेगतिसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _antar_ is called _gati_, when used in the sense of 'non-accepting,' in composition with a verb.
---
The word परिग्रह means 'taking' or 'accepting,' अपरिग्रह means therefore the opposite of this namely 'rejecting,' abandoning. As अन्तर्हत्य गृहंगतः he went away having abandoned home; अन्तर्हतमनृतम् falsehood being abandoned. यदन्तर्हन्ति.

Why do we say 'when meaning to abandon'? Observe अन्तर्हत्वा मूषिकां श्येनोगतः the hawk went away taking hold of the mouse.

Vart:- The word अन्तर् is treated as an _upasarga_ for the purpose of the application of the following rules; (III. 3. 106) by which अङ् is added; rule (III. 3. 92) by which कि is added; the rule (VIII. 4. 14) by which न is changed in to ण. As अन्तर्द्धा, अन्तर्द्धिः and अन्तर्णयति.
