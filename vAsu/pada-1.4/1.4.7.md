sutra: शेषो घ्यसखि
vRtti: शेषो ऽत्र घिसंज्ञो भवति सखिशब्दं वर्जयित्वा । क श्च शेषः ? हृस्वमिवर्णोवर्णान्तंयन्नस्त्र्याख्यं, स्त्र्याख्यं च यन्ननदीसंज्ञकं स शेषः ॥
vRtti_eng: The rest of the words that end in short इ and उ are called _ghi_ with the exception of the word _sakhi_.

This defines the word _ghi_. The peculiarity of the declension of _ghi_ words will be treated later on. The word _hrasva_ is understood in this _sutra_. The word _sesha_ or 'the rest' implies 'the words ending in short इ or उ which are not the names of females, or if they are feminine names, they are not _nadi_ words.'

As अग्नि fire. Before case affixes having an indicatory _n_, the _ghi_ nouns _gunate_ there vowel (VII.3.111). As अग्नि + ङे = अग्ने + ए = अग्नये to the fire. So also  वायु + ङे = वायवे to the wind. But the declension of _sakhi_ in these cases is :- सख्या सख्ये सख्यु and सख्यौ.
