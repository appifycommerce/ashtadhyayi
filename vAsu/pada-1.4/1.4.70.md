sutra: अदोऽनुपदेशे
vRtti: अदः शब्दोऽनुपदेशे गतिसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _adas_ 'that' is called _gati_ when in composition with a verb and not implying a direction to another.

The word _upadesa_ means a direction to another. When a person cogitates within himself and does not address another, that is _anupadesa_. That is when it is not a demonstrative pronoun. As अदः कृत्य, अदः कृतम् and यददः करोति when used as a demonstrative pronoun we have अदः कृत्वा काण्डं गतः.
