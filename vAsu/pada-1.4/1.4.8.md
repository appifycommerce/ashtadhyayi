sutra: पतिः समास एव
vRtti: पतिशब्दः समास एव घिसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _pati_ is called _ghi_ only when it is in a compound.

---
The word _pati_ would have been _ghi_ by the last _sutra_; the present _sutra_ is therefore a _niyama_ rule, restricting the use of _ghi_ in the case of _pati_ to its occurring in composition. The word _eva_ 'only' is used in a restrictive sense.

As पत्या by the lord but प्रजापतिना by the lord of creatures. So also पत्ये and प्रजापतये; पत्युः and प्रजापतेः, पत्यौ and प्रजापतौ &c. When पति is _ghi_, there is _guna_ of the vowel before the four ङित् affixes by (VII.3.111).
