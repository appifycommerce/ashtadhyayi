sutra: ते प्राग्धातोः
vRtti: ते गत्युपसर्गसंज्ञकाः धातोः प्राक् प्रयोक्तव्याः ॥
vRtti_eng: The particles called _gati_ and _upasarga_ are to be employed before the verbal root: (that is to say, they are prefixes).

The word ते has been employed to include the term उपसर्ग also. The preceding examples all illustrate the application of this rule.
