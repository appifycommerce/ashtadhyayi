These particles govern a substantive and qualify a verb and differ from other particles termed _upasarga_ and _gati_. As सुस्तुतं भवता well praised by you. सु सिक्तं भवता you have sprinkled. Here सु is a _karma_ _pravachaniya_ and qualifies the sense of the verb, i. e. it is an adverb. It is not an _upasarga_, for had it been so, it would have changed the स into ष (8.3.65). The term _karma_ _pravachaniya_ is a big term compared with other technical terms such as, टि, घि, घु &c., which generally do not exceed more than two syllables. The word _karmapravachaniya_ is not however merely a technical term; it contains within itself a definition of itself. It means that which qualities or speaks about (प्रोक्तवन्त) an action (कर्म) is so called.
