sutra: अनुर्लक्षणे
vRtti: अनुशब्दो लक्षणे द्योत्ये कर्मप्रवचनीयसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _anu_ when it denotes a sign, is called _karma_-_pravachaniya_.

---
The word _lakshana_ means a sign; an attendant circumstance an invariable concomitant or accident in its logical sense and not merely an occasional concurrence. The force of अनु in this case is that of 'after,' 'in consequence of,' 'because of, or being indicated by.' As जपमनु प्रावर्षम् it rained after or in consequence of the muttering of prayers. To put it in other words, _anu_ is a _karmapravachniya_ when it governs the word which indicates the cause or the attendant circumstance of an action.

So also शाकलस्य संहितामनु प्रावर्षत् = शाकल्येन सुकृतां संहितामनुनिशम्य देवः प्रावर्षत्. The God (clouds) rained having listened to the well performed reading, by _Sakalya_. The force of a _karmapravachaniya_, therefore, when fully analysed will be found to be that of an _upasarga_ whose verb is not expressed in the sentence but is understood; and because of its being so understood, the particle itself seems to govern the noun which in fact was governed by the unexpressed verb. Thus in the above example संहितां is in the accusative case, apparently governed by the preposition अनु, but really governed by the verb अनुनिशम्य understood.

So also अनडुद् यज्ञमन्वसिंचत्. The Taurus sprinkled water after the sacrifice, अगस्त्यमन्वसिंचत् प्रजाः the people began sprinkling water after the rising of the canopus.

Why make unnecessarily this _sutra_, when अनु would have been called _karma_ _pravachaniya_ even by force of sutra (1.4.90) following, where also the word _lakshana_ occurs? This is for the sake of indicating that the _karma_ _pravachaniyas_ should always govern the accusative case (2.3.8) even in expressing हेतु (2.3.23). Otherwise Rule 23rd of the third chapter of Book II would have set aside Rule 8 of the same by the maxim of परत्व (1. 3. 2): and would have caused a _karana_ _pravachaniya_ to govern an Instrumental case where the sense was that of _hetu_.
