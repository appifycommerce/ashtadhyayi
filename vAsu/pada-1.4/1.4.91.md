sutra: अभिरभागे
vRtti: लक्षणादिष्वेव भागवर्जितेऽवभिः कर्मप्रवचनीयसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _abhi_ is _karma_-_pravachaniya_, in the above senses of 'in the direction of,' 'as regards,' and 'each severally' but not when it means division, 'share of.'

The illustrations given under the last _sutra_ _mutus_ _mutandi_ apply here also, with the exception of those given under head (4). As वृक्षमभि विद्योतते; मातरमभि &c. But it is not _karma_-_pravachaniya_ when भाग is meant. भाग means the share which is allotted to one as his own. As यदत्रममाभिष्यात् तद् दीयताम् give that which falls here to my share. Here _abhi_ is an _upasarga_, and therefore स of स्य is changed into ष.
