sutra: अतिरतिक्रमणे च
vRtti: अति शब्दः अतिक्रमणे चकारात् पूजायांच कर्मप्रवचनीयसंज्ञो भवति ॥

The word अतिक्रमण means to do more than what is necessary for the accomplishment of an object. The force of च in the aphorism is to draw in the word पूजायाम् from the last. As अतिसिक्तमेवा भवता. It has abundantly been sprinkled by your honor, अतिस्तुतमिव भवता so also अतिस्तुतं भवता excellently praised by your honor. अति सिक्तं भवता.
