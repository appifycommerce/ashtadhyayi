sutra: पारे मध्ये षष्ठ्या वा
vRtti: पारमध्यशब्दौ षष्ठ्यन्तेन सह विभाषा समस्यते अव्ययीभाव समासो भवति॥
vRtti_eng: The words _para_ across,' and _madhya_ middle' may optionally be compounded with a word ending in the sixth case-affix, when they take the forms _pare_ and _madhye_, and the compound so formed is _Avyayibhava_.

Ordinarily these words would have formed Possessive _Tatpurusha_ compounds. The present _sûtra_ ordains _Avyayibhåva_ instead. The force of वा in the text is that the Genitive _Tatpurusha_ compounding also takes place in the alternative. As पारेगङ्गम् or गङ्गापारम् 'across the Ganges.' मध्येगङ्गम् or गङ्गमध्यम् 'middle of the Ganges.'

Of course according to the option allowed by _sutra_ (II. 1. 11), this compounding need not take place at all, the same sense being expressed by a phrase; as पारं गङ्गायाः or मध्यं गङ्गायाः .
