From this _sutra_ as far as the _sutra_ (II. 2. 23) relating to _Bahuvrihi_ compounds, the word _Tat-purusha_ should be read into each _sutra_. This  big term is of older coinage than that of _Panini_, being, in fact, made by older grammarians. In the _Tat-purusha_ compound, the sense of the last of its elements is the main one, and governs the preceding one. The _Karmadhåraya_ (Appositional Determinative Compound) and _Dwigu_ (Numeral Determinative Compound) are also sub-divisions of this class of compounds. The rest of this chapter and 22 _sůtras_ of the second, deal with this.
