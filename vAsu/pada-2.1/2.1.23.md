sutra: द्विगुश्च
vRtti: द्विगुश्च समासस्तत्पुरुषसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And the kind of compound called _Dwigu_ (Numeral Determinative Compound) is also called _Tat-purusha_.

---
The object of making _Dwigu_ a sub-division of _Tat-purusha_ Compound is that the समासान्त affixes and rules given in (V. 4. 68-160) should apply to _Dwigu_ also. Otherwise we could well have dispensed with this _sutra_; as _sútra_ 52 of this chapter already defines _Dwigu_. Thus पञ्चराज्ञ (V. 4. 91) fem. पञ्चराज्ञी (IV. I. 15., 21), 'an aggregate of 5 princes' द्ववहः, '(V. 4. 89), पञ्चगवम् 'an aggregate of 5 cows.' दशगवम् 'an aggregate of ten cows.' (V. 4. 92.)
