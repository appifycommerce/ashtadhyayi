sutra: प्राक्कडारात्समासः
vRtti: कडारसंशब्दात् प्राग् यानित ऊर्ध्वमनुक्रमिष्यामस्ते समाससंज्ञा वेदितव्याः॥
vRtti_eng: From this point up to the aphorism _kadarakarmadháraye_ (II.2.38), all the terms that we shall say describe will get the designation of _samasa_ or compound.

Thus it will be stated. 'The indeclinable word यया when not meaning like unto.' Here the word समास must be read into the _sutra_ to complete the sense. • In fact this chapter and the second chapter treat of compounds and therefore the word compound must be read in all those aphorisms. 

The word _prák_ is employed for the same purpose as it was used in (I. 4. 56) that is to give the designation of समास to various technical terms like अव्ययीभाव &c. which otherwise would not have got the name of समास.
