sutra: स्तोकान्तिकदूरार्थकृच्छ्राणि क्तेन
vRtti: स्तोक अन्तिक दूर इत्येवमर्थाः शब्दा कृच्छ्र शदश्च पञ्चम्यन्ताः क्तान्तेन सह समस्यन्ते, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Words with the sense of _stoka_ 'a little,' _antika_ 'near,' _dúra_ 'far,' and also the word _krichchhra_ ‘penance,' ending in the 5th case-affix are compounded with what ends in _kta_, and the compound is _Tat-purusha_.

As स्तोकान्मुक्तः 'loosed from a little distance.'

So also अन्तिकादागतः 'come from near' अभ्याशादागतः 'come from near' दूरादागतः 'come from far, विप्रकृष्टादागतः 'come from a distance.' कृच्छ्रान्मुक्तः ‘saved with difficulty.' कृच्छ्रन् लब्धः 'obtained with difficulty.'

By rule (VI. 3. 2) the case-affix is not elided in compounds of this kind.

Vart:- The words शत 'a hundred' and सहस्र 'a thousand' are similarly compounded with the word पर. As, शतात्परे = परश्शताः 'beyond a hundred:' So also परसहस्राः 'beyond a thousand.' In these examples the word शत and सहस्र being exhibited in the 1st case and thus being _upasarjana_ ought to have stood as the first member of the compound (II. 2. 30); But these compounds are supposed to fall under the class of राजदन्त &c, (II. 2. 31) and hence the _upasarjana_ stands as the second member of the compound. Irregularly is also the augment स (सुद्) interposed between these two words.
