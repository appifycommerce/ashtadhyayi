sutra: संज्ञायाम्
vRtti: संज्ञायां विषये सप्तम्यन्तं सुपा सह समस्यते, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A word ending with the 7th case-affix is invariably compounded with a word ending in a case-affix, when the compound thus formed is used as an appellative, and is called _Tat-purusha_ _samása_.

---
A _sanjña_ is expressed by the complete word, hence it is an invariable (_nitya_) compound; for we cannot express an appellative by a sentence.

As, अरण्ये तिलकाः 'wild sesamum' yielding no oil; anything which does not answer to one's expectation. So also अरण्ये माषाः, वने किंशुकाः' anything found unexpectedly.' So also वने बिल्वकाः, कूपे पिशाचकाः.

The case-affix is not elided, in this case, in accordance to _sútra_ (VI. 3. 9.) (The 7th case-affix is not elided after words ending in consonants or in short अ when the compound denotes appellative.)
