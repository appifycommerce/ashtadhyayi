sutra: दिक्संख्ये संज्ञायाम्
vRtti: दिग्वाचिनः शब्दाः संख्या च समानाधिकरणेन सुबन्तेन सह समस्यन्ते, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ।।
vRtti_eng: Tho words expressing a point of the compass, or a number (_sankhyá_) enter into composition with the word correlated to them by being in the same case, when the sense of the compound is that of an appellative; and it is a _Tat-purusha_.

The phrase 'being in apposition,' is understood in every one of these _sútras_ up to the end of the chapter.

- As पूर्वेषुकामशमी 'the town of _Ishukamasami_ -in-the-east.' अपरेषुकामशमी the town of _Ishukamasami_ -in-the-west.' पञ्चाम्राः 'the five mangoes' सप्तर्षयः 'the seven-sages' (the constellation of the Great Bear),

Why do we say ‘when the sense is that of an appellative ?' Observe उत्तरा वृक्षाः 'northern trees.' पञ्च ब्राह्मणाः 'five Brahmanas.' See (IV. 2. 107.)
