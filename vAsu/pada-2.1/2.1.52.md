First to take an example of _Taddhitartha_:-as, पञ्चेषु कपालेषु संस्कृतः = पञ्चकपालः 'an offering prepared or offered in five cups.' So also दशकपालः 'prepared in tea cups.' These are names of _Purodása_ offerings; and are formed by adding the affix अण् in the sense of 'refining an object of food' by sūtra (IV. 2. 16); then this affix is elided (लुक्) by (IV. 1, 88).

To take an example when an additional member comes after the compound. As पञ्चनावप्रियः loving five ships. द्विनावरुप्यम् money which has come by two ships' (द्वि+नौ+टच् (V. 4. 99) = द्विनाव)

Of an aggregate we have पञ्चपूली. The feminine is formed by (IV. 1. 21).
