sutra: किं क्षेपे
vRtti: किमित्येतत् क्षेपे गम्यमाने सुपा सह समस्यते , तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _kim_ 'what,' when implying 'contempt,’ is compounded with a word ending in a case-affix, and the compound is _Tat-purusha_.

As किं राजा यो न रक्षति 'he is a bad king who does not protect his subjects.' किं सखा योऽभिद्रुह्यति ‘he is a bad friend who hates.' किं गौः यो न वहति 'it is a bad ox that does not carry.'

The affix टच् (V. 4.91) does not come after this compound as in महाराजः मद्रराजः &c., by force of Rule (V.4.70). Otherwise the form would have been किंराज and not किंराजा.

Why do we say 'when censure is implied?’ Observe कस्य राजा = किंराजः 'whose king;' किंसखः
