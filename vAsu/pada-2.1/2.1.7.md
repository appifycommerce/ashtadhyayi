sutra: यथा सादृश्ये
vRtti: यथेत्येदव्ययमसादृश्ये वर्तमानां सुपा सह समस्यते, अव्ययीभावश्च समासो भवति॥
vRtti_eng: The indeclinable word _yathá_ when it does not signify 'likeness' is invariably compounded with a word ending in a case-affix which is in construction with it and the compound is called an _Avyayibháva _Samása_.

Thus यथावृद्धम् ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयस्व  invite every old _Brahmana_. So also यथाध्यापकम्.

Why do we say 'when not signifying likeness?'. For there is no composition when likeness is indicated. As यथादेवदत्तस्तथा यज्ञदत्तः  As is _Devadatta_  so is _Yajñadatta_.

This _samása_ could have been included in the last _sútra_ clause to, but making a separate _sútra_  shows that the word यथार्थवचन there must be limited by the present _sútra_, to first three meanings of the word यथा given there and not to its fourth meaning. vis. there is no compounding when it means likeness.
