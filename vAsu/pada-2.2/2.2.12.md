sutra: क्तेन च पूजायाम् ॥
vRtti: को वः पूजायां विहितस्तेन पष्ठी न समस्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: A word ending with a sixth case-affix is not compounded with a word ending with the affix '_kta_,' when the force of '_kta_' is to denote 'respect' &c.

---
The affix क्त is added in the sense of inclination, understanding or respect by _sutra_ (3.2.188). The present _sutra_ alludes to that aphorism when it uses the word पूजाः and puja itself is used only as an illustration and includes the other two significations of '_kta_' also, namely _mati_ 'inclination,' and buddhi 'understanding.'

As राज्ञां मतः -बुद्धः - पूजितः 'the king wishes, understands or respects.'

Why do we say 'when meaning respect'? When '_kta_' has not this signification there is compounding. As छात्रहसितं 'pupil's laughing.'
