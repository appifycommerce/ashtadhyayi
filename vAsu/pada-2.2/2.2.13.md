sutra: अधिकरणवाचिना च ॥
vRtti: अधिकरणवाचिना क्तेन षष्ठी न समस्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: A word ending with a sixth case-affix is not compounded with a word ending with the affix '_kta_,' when the force of the latter is to denote 'locality' in which something has happened.

When the affix क्त is attached to roots denoting 'fixedness, motion or eating', it gives the sense of agent and of location in connection with the action denoted by the roots i.e., that the action is located by the agent in this or that site (III.4.76); as इदमेषां यातम् ' here they have gone.'  इदमेषां भुक्तम् 'here they have eaten.'
