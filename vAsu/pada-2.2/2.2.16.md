sutra: कर्तरि च॥
vRtti: कर्तरि च यौ तृजकौ ताभ्यां सह षष्ठी न समस्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: A word ending with the sixth case-affix is not compounded with a word ending with '_trich_'or '_aka_' affix when the force of these latter affixes is that of an agent.
---
The word '_kartari_' qualifies the word '_aka_' only and not '_trich_,' for the latter always denotes the agent and nothing else.

As अपां क्षष्टा 'the creator of waters' पुरां भेत्ता 'the destroyer of cities' वज्रस्य भर्ता 'the holder of thunderbolt.'

It might be suggested that the word भर्तृ being read in the class of याजक (sutra 9) ought to be compounded. The word भर्तृ there means 'husband,' while in the example we have given, it means 'holder.'

The above are examples of words formed by तृच्. Now we shall give examples of words formed by अक, thus ओदनस्य भोजकः 'the eater of rice,' सक्तूनां पायकः 'the drinker of _saktu_.'
