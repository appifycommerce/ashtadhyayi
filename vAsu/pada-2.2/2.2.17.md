sutra: नित्यं क्रीडाजीविकयोः ॥
vRtti: क्रीडायां जीविकायां च नित्यं पष्ठी समस्यते तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A word ending with a sixth case-affix is invariably compounded with a word ending with _aka_, when these affixes denote a sport or a livelihood; and the compound is _Tat-purusha_.

This is a Nitya-samasa incapable of analysis. This anuvritti of the word 'na' which began with _sútra_ 10, does not extend further. The affix तृच्  never has the sense of sporting or livelihood; the only examples possible are of '_aka_.' Thus उद्दालकपुष्पभजिका 'a sort of game played by the people in the eastern districts in which _uddalaka_ flowers are broken or crushed.' So also वारणपुष्पप्रचायिका 'a play of gathering flowers.'

So also दन्तलेखकः 'one who earns his bread by painting or marking the teeth.' नखलेखक 'a nail-painter by profession.'

Why do we say 'when meaning sporting or livelihood.' Observe ओदनस्य भोजकः.
