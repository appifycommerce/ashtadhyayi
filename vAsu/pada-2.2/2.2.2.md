The word or is neuter when it means exactly equal parts or bisec tion. 
The word gamefut and pairatu are understood here. This sätra also debars sutra g; as wefrorrat - Avoit 'a half of the pepper'; 
l et a half of the Kosátakt.' 
... Why do we say " when it is neuter'? Otherwise we bave T 'hall the village'? T: 'half the city. 
The word 'ekadesin' must also be taken here. Thus in the sentence The could carry a half of the animal is of Devadatta'; we cannot compound the word 'ardha' with 'Devadatta.' 
The word 'ekadhikarapa' must also be taken here. So we cannot com pound of factory 'the half of the peppers.'
