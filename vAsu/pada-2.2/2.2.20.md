sutra: अमैवाव्ययेन ॥
vRtti: अव्ययेनोपपदस्य यः समासः सोऽमैव भवति नान्येन ॥
vRtti_eng: When an _upapada_ is compounded with an indeclinable , then it is compounded only with those _avyayas_ which end in the affix अम्.

---
This makes a restriction, to the general compounding of _upapadas_ with _avyayas_ as ordained by the last rule. As स्वादुकारं भुङ्क्ते  'he eats having made his food sweet.' So also लवणकारं 'having seasoned. The _avyayas_ ending in अम् are formed by the affix ण्मुल् (III.4.26) &c.

Why do we say 'with _avyayas_       ending in अम्'?  Observe कालो भोक्तुम्  'the time of eating.' Here the _avyaya_ ends in उम् of the affix तुमुन् added by rule (III.3.167) (the affix _tumun_ may be applied, when the word in construction is not a verb, but काल, समय or वेला 'time.')

The force of the word only is to indicate that this composition takes place in those cases where a rule ordains अम् only, after any root with regard to any upapada; so that no composition will take place where the affix अम् as well as another affix is ordained after a root with certain _upapadas_. Thus _sutra_ (III.4.24), declares: "the affixes क्त्वा and णमुल् come after a verb when the words अमे, प्रथम and पूर्व are _upapadas_." Here the अम् (affix णमुल्) is not the sole affix ordained; but there is a co-ordinate affix with it namely क्त्वा. Therefore in अग्रेभोजम् 'having first eaten' there is no composition because अग्रेभोजम् is not the only form we can have; for, अग्रेभुक्त्वा is also used in the same sense.
