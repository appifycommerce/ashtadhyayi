vRtti_eng: An _upapada_ ending with a third case-affix (III. 4. 47) &c., is compounded optionally with an indeclinable formed by the affix अम् and the compound is _Tatpurusha_.

The term अम् is understood here. The _upapadas_ ending with a third case-affix &c., are given in _sutra_ (III. 4. 47) and the sutras that follow. As मूलकोपदंशं मुङ्क्ते or मूलकेनोपदंशं भुङ्क्ते  'he eats after having relished the food with radish.' So also पार्श्वोपपीड or पार्श्वयोरुपपीडम् शेते (Ill. 4. 49) 'he lies pressing on his ribs.' For _upapadas_ ending with other cases, see _sutra_  (III. 4. 52) &c. This being an optional rule, it is not necessary that the _upapada_ should be _tulya-vidhana_ with the अम् ; so that this optional compounding may take place even under rule (III. 4. 59) where अम् is not the only affix enjoined, but there is क्त्वा as well. This _vibhasha_ may therefore be called both प्राप्त and अप्राप्त _vibhasha_. It is प्राप्त with regard to those rules where अम् is the only affix employed; and it is अप्राप्त with regard to those where श्रम् is not the only affix.
