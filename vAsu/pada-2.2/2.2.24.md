sutra:  अनेकमन्यपदार्थे ॥
vRtti:  अनेकं सुबन्तमन्यपदार्थे वर्त्तमानं समस्यते बहुव्रीहिश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Two or more words, ending in any case affix, form a compound, denoting another new thing, not connoted by those words individually; and the compound is called Bahuvrihi.
---
The _Bahuvrihi_ compound comes with the force of all the affixes but the first; as प्राप्तमुदकं ग्रामं = प्राप्तोदको ग्रामः 'a water-reached village. ' ऊढरथोऽनड्वान्  'a bull by whom a cart is drawn.'  'उपहृतपशूरुद्रः 'Rudra to whom cattle is offered,' उदृतौदना स्थाली 'a vessel which rice is placed.' चित्रगुर्देवदत्तः 'Devadatta possessed of a brindled cow.' वीरपुरुषको ग्रामः 'a village possessed of heroic men.'

_Bahuvrihi_ compound is not formed with the sense of the first case. As वृष्टे देवे गतः 'gone when it had rained.'

Why do we say 'more than one'? So that there may be compounding of many words, as in the following verse:-

सुसूक्ष्मजटकेशेन सुञभाजिनवाससा। पुत्री पर्वतराजस्य कुतो हेतोर्विवाहिता ॥.

'Why was the daughter of the king of the mountains married by _Siva_ possessed of beautifully-delicate-locked-hair, and cheap deer-skin-dress.'
