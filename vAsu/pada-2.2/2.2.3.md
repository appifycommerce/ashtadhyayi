sutra: द्वितीयतृतीयचतुर्थतुर्याण्यन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: द्वितीयादीनि शब्दरूपाणि एकदेशिनैकाधिकरणेन सहान्यतरस्यां समस्यन्ते तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The words _dvitiya_, 'second,' _tritiya_ 'third,' _chaturtha_ 'fourth,' and _turya_ 'fourth,' are optionally compounded with that word which signifies a thing that has parts, provided that the thing having parts is distinguished numerically by unity. The compound so formed is called _Tat-purusha_.

This also debars _sūtra_9. By the force of the word 'optionally' used here, (II.2.9). also applies. The prohibition contained in (II.2.11). as to the compounding of a genitive with an ordinal, does not apply here; for that rule can find its scope in other ordinals than those mentioned here.

As द्वितीयं भिक्षायाः=द्वितीयभिक्षा  'second begging’. When we apply _sutra_ 9. we have भिक्षादितीयं. So also with the words तृतीयभिक्षा, चतुर्थभिक्षा, तुर्यभिक्षा.

Vari: -The word तुरीय 'fourth' should also be included. As भिक्षातुरीय or तुरीयभिक्षा.

But we cannot form compounds, for reasons given in the last _sutra_, of the phrases द्वितीयं भिक्षाया भिक्षुकस्य or द्वितीयं भिक्षाणाम् .
