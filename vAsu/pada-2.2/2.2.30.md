sutra: उपसर्जनं पूर्वम् ॥
vRtti: उपसर्जनसंशक समासे पूर्व प्रयोक्तव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: The _upasarjana_ ( I. 2. 43 ) is to be placed first in a compound.

---
The word समासे is understood here. The _upasarjana_ being the word exhibited in the nominative case in the rules relating to _samasa_, must stand first. The constant application of this rule has been illustrated in the previous aphorisms. Without this rule, there would have been no fixity as to the position of words.
