sutra:  द्वन्द्वे घि ॥
vRtti: द्वन्द्वे समासे घ्यन्तं पूर्वं प्रयोक्तम्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: In a _Dvandva_ compound, let a word called घि (I. 4.7) stand first.
---
As हरिहरौ  '_Hari_ and _Hara_.' So also पटुगुप्तौ and मृदुगुप्तौ. Where there are more than one such for words घि in a compound, any one may be fixed upon as first member, and the rest to follow no fixed rulc, As पटुमृदुशुक्ला: or पदुशुक्लमृदव्:.

Why do we say '_Dvandva_'? Observe विस्पष्टपटुः which is Tat-purusha.
