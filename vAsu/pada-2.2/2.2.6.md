As न ब्राह्मणः = अब्राह्मणः ’who is not a _Brahmana_,' (though a man). The म् of न is elided by (VI.3.73):

Vart: - The न् of न is also elided even when the second member is a verb, provided that censure is implied as अपचसि त्वं जाल्म 'thou cookest not O knave.'

The word नञ् has six senses: (1) सादृश्य 'likeness or resemblance'; as अब्राह्मणः 'one like a _Brahmana_ and wearing the sacred thread &c., but not a _Brahmana_, but a _Kshatriya_ or a _Vaisya_.' (2) अभाव 'absence,' 'negation,' 'want,' or 'privation,' as अज्ञान 'absence of knowledge.' (3) भेदः 'difference' or 'distinction,' as अपटः 'not a cloth, but something different from or other than a cloth'. (4) अल्पता 'smallness,' 'diminution' used as diminutive particle, as अनुदरा' having a slender waist.' (5) अप्राशस्त्य 'badness,'  'unfitness,' having a depreciative sense, as अकाल 'wrong or improper time.' (6) विरोध 'opposition,' 'contrariety,' as अनीतिः 'opposite of morality,' 'immorality.'
