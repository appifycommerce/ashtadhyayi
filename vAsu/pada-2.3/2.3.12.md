sutra: गत्यर्थकर्मणि द्वितीयाचतुर्थ्यौ चेष्टायामनध्वनि
vRtti: गत्यर्थानां धातूनां चेष्टाक्रियाणां परिस्पन्दक्रियाणां कर्मणि कारकेऽध्ववर्जिते द्वितीयाचतुर्थ्यौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: In the case of roots implying motion, the place to which motion is directed takes the affix of the 2nd (Accusative) or the 4th (Dative) case in denoting the 'object,' when physical motion is meant, and the object is not a word expressing 'road'.

---
Ex. ग्रामं or ग्रामाय गच्छति 'he goes to the village.' But not so in मनसा हरिं व्रजति (the verb not denoting physical motion) 'he goes mentally to _Hari_' अध्वानं गच्छति 'he goes over the way' (the object being the 'way'). But not so in ओदनं पचति 'he cooks rice;' (the verb not denoting 'motion') nor in अश्वेन व्रजति (the verb not denoting 'the object.')

Note.- The word _adhvan_ includes the synonyms of road (1. 1. 68) as पन्थानं गच्छति, मार्गं गच्छति.

Note.- The prohibition applies with regard to the going over or occupying the road; so that where a person from a wrong road goes to the right road, there the fourth case-affix will be employed as पथे गच्छति.
