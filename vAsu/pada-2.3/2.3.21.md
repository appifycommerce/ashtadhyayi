जटाभिस्तापसः 'he is an ascetic by (the fact of his having) matted hair.' अपि भवान् कमण्डलुना छात्रमद्राक्षीत् 'your honor might see the student by the fact of his having a _kamandalu_.' So also छात्रेणोपाध्यायम् 'a teacher by the fact of having students.' शिखया परिव्राजकम् 'a _Parivrajaka_ by a tuft of hair.' But not so here, कमण्डलुपाणिछात्रः ' a student has _kamandalu_ in his hand.' Because here in the compound, कमण्डलुपाणि is hidden the mark.

Why do we say _ittha_-_bhuta_? Observe वृक्षं प्रति विद्योतनं.
