sutra: हेतौ
vRtti: फलसाधनयोग्यः पदार्थो लोके हेतुरुच्यते, तद्वाचिनस्तृतीया विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When a word denotes 'cause,' it takes the third case-affix.

विद्यया यशः 'by learning there is produced fame.' धनेन कुलम् 'by wealth, family;' कन्यया शोकः 'by daughter there is grief.'

The word हेतु here is used in its popular sense and not the grammatical _hetu_ (I.4.55). Any  thing capable of accomplishing a desired object is called _hetu_.
