sutra: अकर्तर्यृणे पञ्चमी
vRtti: कर्तृवर्जितं यदृणं हेतुस्ततः पञ्चमी विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A word, implying debt, considered as a 'cause' but not as a _kartri_ or agent, takes the fifth case-affix.

Ex. शताद्बद्धः 'he has been bound on account of a debt of a hundred pieces.'

Why do we say 'when not denoting the agent ?' Observe शतेन बन्धितः; 'a debt of hundred has thrown him in prison'; here शत being considered as a _prayojaka_ _hetu_, is an agent and takes the third case-affix.
