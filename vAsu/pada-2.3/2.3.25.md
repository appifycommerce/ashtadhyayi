sutra: विभाषा गुणेऽस्त्रियाम्
vRtti: गुणे हेतावस्त्रीलिङ्गे विभाषा पञ्चमी विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The fifth case-affix is employed optionally when the noun expresses an attribute, being the cause of an action, and not being of the feminine gender."

Ex. जाड्येन जाड्यताम् वा बद्धः 'he has been bound by reason of his dullness.' पांडित्येन or पांडित्याद् मुक्तः 'saved through learning.'

_Guna_-_vachana_ nouns are generally abstract nouns. Therefore not here धनेन कुलम्. If an abstract noun is of feminine gender, this rule will not apply, as वुद्ध्या or प्रज्ञया मुक्तः 'he was set at liberty on account of his skill or wisdom.'
