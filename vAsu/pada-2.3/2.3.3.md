sutra: तृतीया च होश्छन्दसि
vRtti: छन्दसि विषये जुहोतेः कर्मणि कारके तृतीया विभक्तिर्भवति द्वितीया च ॥
vRtti_eng: "In the _chhandas_ (_veda_), the object of the verb _hu_ 'to sacrifice' takes the affix of the third case, and of the second as well."
---
This ordains the third case-affix, and by force of the word च 'and' the second case-affix is also employed as यवाग्वाग्निहोत्रं जुहोति 'he satisfies or pleases _Agni_ with barley-powder,' or यवागुमग्निहोत्रं जुहोति 'he throws barley-powder into the fire as oblation.'

Why do we say 'in the vedas?' In the classical Sanskrit, the accusative only must be used and not the instrumental.
