sutra: सप्तम्यधिकरणे च
vRtti: सप्तमी विभक्तिर्भवत्यधिकरणे कारके चकाराद्दूरान्तिकार्थेभ्यश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: The seventh case-affix is employed when the sense is that of location (I. 4. 45) as well as after the words meaning 'distant' or 'near'.

---
Ex. कटे आस्ते 'he sits on the mat' अन्तिके दूरे वा ग्रामस्य 'near or distant from the village.' स्थाल्यां पचति 'he cooks in the pot.' Thus the words दूर and अन्तिक take four case-affixes, namely the second, third, fifth and seventh.
Vart:- Words like अधीतिन् 'who has learnt,' गृहीतिन् 'who has comprehended;' i. e., words formed by adding इन् to the past participle in क्त, govern the locative of that which forms their object:- as अधीती व्याकरणे 'versed in grammar.' परिगणिती यज्ञिके 'well versed in sacrificial rites.' आम्नान्ती छन्दसि 'well read in the _Veda_.' See (V.2.88).

Vart:- The words साधु and असाधु govern the locative of that towards whom goodness or otherwise is shown; as मातरि साधुरसाधु वा 'well behaved or ill-behaved towards his mother.'

Vart:- The Locative absolute is used in cases other than those specified in the next _sutra_, namely, in cases where the action done or suffered does not indicate the time of another action; as ऋद्धेषु भुञ्जानेषु दरिद्रा आसते 'the poor are sitting, while the rich are eating,' दरिद्रेषु आसीनेषु ऋद्धाभुञ्जते 'the rich are eating, while the poor being seated.' So also vice versa.

Vart:- The Locative is sometimes used to denote the object or purpose for which anything is done; as.

चर्मणि द्वीपिनं हंति, दंतयोर्हन्तिकुंजरम् ।
केशेषु चमरीं हंति सोम्नि पुष्कलको हतः ॥

'Man kills the tiger for his skin, the elephant for his tusks, for _chamari_ cow for her hair, and the musk-deer for its musk.'
