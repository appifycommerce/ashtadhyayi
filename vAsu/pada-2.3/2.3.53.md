sutra: कृञः प्रतियत्ने
vRtti: करोतेः कर्मणि कारके शेषत्वेन विवक्षिते प्रतियत्ने गम्यमाने षष्ठी विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The object of the verb _kri_ takes the sixth case-affix, when it means 'to impart a new quality or virtue (1. 3. 32).
---
Ex. एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the wood gives a new quality to the water' (or he prepares the wood and water for sacrifice). (By (VI. 1. 139), स is inserted).

When प्रतियत्न is not meant, the second case-affix is employed: as कटं करोति.

The word शेष is also understood here. So that we have also एधोदकमुपस्कुरुते ॥
