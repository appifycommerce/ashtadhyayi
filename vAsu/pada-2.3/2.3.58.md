sutra: दिवस्तदर्थस्य
vRtti: व्यवहृपणिसमानार्थस्य दीव्यतेः कर्मणि षष्ठी विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The object of the verb _div_ when having the above-mentioned sense of 'dealing' or 'staking,' takes the sixth case-affix.

---
Ex. शतस्य दीव्यति 'he stakes or deals in a hundred.' But not in ब्राह्मणं दीव्यति 'he jokes with the _Brahmana_.'

The _yoga_ _vibhaga_ when this root might well have been included in the last aphorism, is for the sake of the succeeding _sutras_, in which the _anuvritti_ of दिव runs, and not of others.
