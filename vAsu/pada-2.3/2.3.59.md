sutra: विभाषोपसर्गे
vRtti: उपसर्गे सति दिवस्तदर्थस्य कर्मणि कारके षष्ठी विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The object of the verb _div_ when having the above-mentioned sense of dealing or staking, optionally takes the sixth case-affix, when it is preceded by an _upasarga_ (or preposition)."
---
Ex. शतस्य शतं वा प्रति दीव्यति 'he deals in or stakes a hundred.' But no option is allowed when the verb is simple as in the last aphorism; nor does this rule apply when the sense is not that of dealing or gambling. As, शलाकां प्रति दीव्यति 'he throws the missile.'
