मासेनानुवाकोऽधीतः 'he learnt the _Anuvaka_ in a month,' क्रोशेनानुवाकोऽधीतः 'he learnt the _Anuvaka_ by going over a _kos_.

The word अपवर्ग means 'the finishing of an action, on the attainment of the object intended by the action, but not before.' Thus संवत्सरेणानुवाकोऽधीतः means '_Anuvaka_ was persaveringly and effectually read by him in the whole year.'

When the idea of _apavarga_ is not intended, the accusative case is employed, as मासमधीतोऽनुवाकः 'learnt for a month, but not yet completed, the _Anuvaka_.'
