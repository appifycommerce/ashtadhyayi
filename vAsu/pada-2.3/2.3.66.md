sutra: उभयप्राप्तौ कर्मणि
vRtti: उभयोः प्राप्तिर्यस्मिन्कृति सोयमुभयप्राप्तिस्तत्रकर्मण्येव षष्ठी विभक्तिर्भवति, न कतरि ॥
vRtti_eng: When the agent and the object of the action denoted by the words formed by _krit_-affixes, are both used in a sentence, in the object only, the sixth case-affix is employed, and not in the agent (the object is put in the genitive case and not the agent).

आश्चर्य्यो गवां दोहोऽगोपालकेन 'the milking of a cow without a cowherd is a wonder.' रोचते मे ओदनस्य भोजनं देवदत्तेन. 'The eating of rice by _Devadatta_ pleases me;' पयसः पानं यज्ञदत्तेन 'the drinking of milk by _Yajnadatta_.'

Vart:- When the agent and object are both used, the agent is put in the instrumental, or genitive case, when, as some say, the _krit_ terminations are of the feminine gender, or as others say, when the terminations are of any gender; as, विचित्रा जगतः कृतिर्हरेर्हरिणा वा 'the creation of the world by _Hari_ is wonderful' शब्दानामनुशासनमाचार्य्येण आचार्यस्यवा 'the dissertation on words by the _acharya_' पवित्राहि सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनेः  or पाणिनिना वा 'beautiful is the structure of _sutra_ by _Panini_.' _Apte_.
