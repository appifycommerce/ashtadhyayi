sutra: क्तस्य च, वर्त्तमाने
vRtti: क्तस्य वर्तमानकालविहितस्य प्रयोगे षष्ठी विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The past participle ending in क्त when used in the sense of the present tense, (III. 2. 187) and (III. 2. 188) is used with the genitive.

Ex. राज्ञां पूजितः 'honored by kings,' अहमेवमतो महीपतेः 'I alone am regarded by the king.'

Why do we say 'क्त'? Observe ओदनं पचमानः 'rice is cooked.' Why do we say 'when denoting the present tense'?  Observe ग्रामं गतः 'gone to the village.'

Vart:- When used as abstract neuter nouns, past participles are used with the genitive, as मयूरस्य नृत्तं 'the dancing of a peacock' छात्रस्य हसितं 'the laughing of the student'. कोकिलस्य व्याहूतम् 'the screaming of the cuckoo.' When, however, agent is desired to be particularised, the instrumental case is employed : as छात्रेण हसितम्.

This _sutra_ debars _sutra_ (II.3.69) by which genitive is prohibited after _Nishtha_ affixes. This is an exception to that _sutra_.
