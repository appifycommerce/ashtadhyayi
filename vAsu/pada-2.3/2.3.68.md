sutra: अधिकरणवाचिनश्च
vRtti: क्तोधिकरणे चेति वक्ष्यति तस्य प्रयोगे षष्ठी विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The past participle in क्त is used with the genitive when the former expresses location (III. 4. 76)."

This also is an exception to the prohibition about _Nishtha_ contained in (II. 3. 69). As इदमेषामासितम् 'this is their seat.' इदमेषां शयितं 'this is their sleeping.'

In connection with verbs taking two objects, both take the genitive case, when a word ending in _krit_-affix denotes the agent, as they would have taken the accusative : as, नेताऽश्वस्य ग्रामस्य चैत्रः '_Chaitra_ is the leader of the horse of the village.' When, however, one is the principal, then the object takes the genitive : as, नेताऽश्वस्य ग्रामं चैत्रः, '_Chaitra_ leads the horse to the village.'
