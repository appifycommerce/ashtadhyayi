Ex. अद्य भुक्त्वा देवदत्तो द्व्यहे द्व्यहाद्वाभोक्ता 'having dined today, _Devadatta_ will dine in or after two days.' Here the 'time' is the interval between the agent and his power of eating. So also इहस्थोऽयमिष्वासः क्रोशात् क्रोशे वा लक्ष्यं विध्येत् 'standing here, he will hit a mark at the distance of one _kos_. Here _kos_ is the interval between the agent and the object or the object and the ablation, or the object and the location. The rule (1. 3. 10) does not apply here.
