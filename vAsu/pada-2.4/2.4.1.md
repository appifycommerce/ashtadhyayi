sutra: द्विगुरेकवचनम्
vRtti: द्विगुः समासः एकवचनं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The compound _Dvigu_ (II. 1. 52) is singular in number.
---
The word एकवचन is a genitive _Tat_-_purusha_ compound meaning 'the expression for one,' that is to say, it expresses the sense of unity. The rule therefore, enjoins that the sense inherent in a _Dvigu_ compound is that of unity.

This is confined to _Samahara_ _Dvigu_ i.e., an aggregate compound taken in a collective sense. As, पञ्चगवं 'an aggregate of five cows', पञ्चपली (IV.1. 21.). The sense of _Dvigu_ being that of one, it follows that it retains the singular number even when further modified by other affixes, and used as an attributive and though no longer a _Dvigu_, as, पञ्चपूलीयं शोभना ॥
