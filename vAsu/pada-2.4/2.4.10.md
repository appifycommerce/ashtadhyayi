sutra: शूद्राणामनिरवसितानाम्
vRtti: अनिरवसितशूद्रवाचिनां शब्दानां द्वन्द्व एकवद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A _Dvandva_ compound of words denoting those classes of _Sudras_ who have not been expelled from the communion of higher classes, is singular.

Thus, तक्षायस्करम् 'the carpenter and the blacksmith'; रजकतन्तुवायम् 'the washerman and the weaver.'

The word अनिर्वासित means one not expelled (from the dish).

A _Sudra_ who can take food from the dish of a higher class, without permanently defiling that vessel, is called an _Anirvasita_ _Sudra_.

Why do we say 'not expelled'? Observe चण्डालमृतपाः 'the _Chandala_ and the _Mritapa_.'
