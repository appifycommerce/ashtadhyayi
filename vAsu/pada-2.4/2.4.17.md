sutra: स नपुंसकम्
vRtti: यस्यायमेकवद्भावो विहितः स नपुंसकलिङ्गो भवति द्विगुर्द्वन्द्वश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: It, namely the _Dvigu_ or the _Dvandva_ compound, with regard to which singular number has been ordained by the above rules, is always a neuter gender.

As, दशगवम् 'an aggregate of ten cows,' पाणिपादम् 'hands and feet.' शिरोग्रीवम् 'head and neck.'

This _sutra_ debars the operation of the rule by which a compound gets the gender of its subsequent member. See (2.4.26).

Vart:- A _Dvigu_, the last member of which ends in short अ, is employed in the feminine gender only; as पञ्चपूली, दशरथी.

Vart:- A _Dvigu_, the last member of which is a feminine word ending in आप् affix, is optionally feminine; as, पञ्चखट्वम् or पञ्चखट्वी.

Vart:- A _Dvigu_, the last member of which is a word ending in अन्, is optionally feminine and the न is elided : as पञ्चतक्षम् or पञ्चतक्षी.

Vart:- A Prohibition must be stated in the case of _Dvigu_ compounds ending in पात्र &c., पञ्चपात्रम्; चतुर्युगम्; त्रिभुवनम्.
