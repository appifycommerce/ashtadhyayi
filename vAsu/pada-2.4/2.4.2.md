sutra: द्वन्द्वश्च प्राणितूर्यसेनाङ्गानाम्
vRtti: प्राण्यङ्गानां द्वन्द्व एकवद्भवति, तथातूर्याङ्गानां सेनाङ्गानां च ॥
vRtti_eng: "A _Dvandva_ compound too is singular in number, when it is compounded of words signifying members of the animal body, players (or singers or dancers) and component parts of an army."
---
As, पाणिपादम्, 'the hand and foot' शिरोग्रीवं 'the head and neck' मार्दङ्गिकपाणविकम् 'players on the _mridanga_ and _panava_ (kinds of drums)' रथिकाश्वरोहम् 'the soldiers on chariot and horse.' वीणावादकपरिवादकस्, रथिकपादातम् ॥

This rule applies to cases of _Samahara_ _Dvandva_ or aggregate _Dvandva_ Compounds only; and not to _Itaretara_ _Dvandva_ (II. 2. 29.)

In the _Dvandva_ Compounds of animals such as elephants, horses, &c., the singular is optional; (II. 4. 12.) The present rule also gives us an index as to where we must make _Samahara_ _Dvandva_ and where an _Itaretara_ _Dvandva_. The _Dvandva_ compounds of words signifying members of animal body, players or army, are always and solely _Samahara_ _Dvandva_. The compounds of words like दधिपयसी 'curd and milk' (II. 4. 14.) are purely _Itaretara_ _Dvandva_ and can never be _Samahara_ _Dvandva_; while compounds of words denoting tree, animals &c., (II. 4. 12.) are optionally either _Samahara_ or _Itaretara_ _Dvandva_.
