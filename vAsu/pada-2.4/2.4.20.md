sutra: संज्ञायां कन्थोशीनरेषु
vRtti: संज्ञायां विषये कन्थान्तस्तत्पुरुषो नपुंसकलिङ्गो भवति , सा चेत् कन्था उशीनरेषु भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "When denoting an appellative, a _Tatpurusha_ compound ending with the word _kantha_ 'town,' is neuter in gender, provided that it is the name of a town situated in the country of the _Usinaras_."
---
As, सोशमिकन्थम् 'the town of _Sausami_'; आह्वरकन्थम् 'the town of _Ahwara_.'

When not an appellative, the form is different; as, वीरणकन्था. So also if the town is not in the country of the _Usinaras_, as दाक्षिकन्था.

This debars the rule (II. 4. 25.) by which a compound gets the gender of its subsequent term. (For accent see (IV. 2. 124.))
