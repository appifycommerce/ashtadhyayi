sutra: पूर्ववदश्ववडवौ
vRtti: अश्ववडवयोः पूर्ववल्लिङ्गं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The gender of the compound of the word _asva_ 'horse' and _vadava_ 'a mare,' is like that of the first word in it.

This applies where the compound is not an aggregate by rule (II.4.12); in that case it will be neuter, अश्ववडवाविमौ; अश्ववडवान्, अश्ववडवैः &c., (in every number and case) 'those two (mas.) the horse and the mare.' This is an exception to the last and general rule, by which the gender of the subsequent term, guides the gender of the whole compound.
