The word इदम् is also understood in this _sutra_ though it was not so in the last. This skipping is technically called 'frog-leap.' Thus:- इमं or एतं छात्रं छन्दोऽध्यापय, अथो एमं व्याकरणमप्यध्यापय 'teach this pupil Prosody, and teach him Grammar also,' अनेन or एतेन छात्रेण रात्रिरधीता 'अथो एनेनाहरप्यधीतम् 'this pupil studied in the night and he studied in the day also'. अनयोः or एतयोः छात्रयोः शोभनं शीलम्, अथो एनयोः प्रभूतं स्वं 'the family of these two students is respectable and their wealth is great.'

Vart:- The word एनत् neuter and singular, is also used in _anvadesa_: as, इदम् कुण्डमानय प्रक्षालयैनत् 'bring this bowl and wash it.' The above three _Sutra_ regulate the accent only of certain pronouns.
