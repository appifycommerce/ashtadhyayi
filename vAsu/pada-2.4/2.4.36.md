sutra: अदो जग्धिर्ल्यप्ति किति
vRtti: अदो जग्धिरादेशो भवति ल्यपि परतः तकारादौ च किति प्रत्यये ॥
vRtti_eng: The word जग्धि is the substitute of अप् \"to eat,\" when the affix ल्यप् (VII. 1. 37) or an _ardhadhatuka_ कित् affix beginning with त follows.
---
प्रजग्ध्य 'Having eaten.' (प्र + अद् + ल्यप् = प्र + जग्ध् + य). So also जग्ध 'eaten' (अद्  + क्त =जग्ध् + त).

The इ in जग्धि is merely for the sake of articulation and is not an _anubandha_, otherwise there would have been the insertion of the nasal न (नुम्). So also the इ in वचि &c, is merely for the sake of articulation. But अद् + क्त = अन्नः 'food' is an irregularity.

The employment of ल्यप् in this _sutra_ indicates the existence of this _Paribhasha_. 'A _bahiranga_ substitution of ल्यप् supersedes even _antaranga_ rules.' Because in case this maxim did not exist, the substitution of जग्ध् for अद् before ल्यप् which is taught in this _sutra_, would follow already from the word किति (before that which is distinguished by an indicatory क) in this rule, i. e., जग्ध् would (by maxim 'that which is _bahiranga_ is regarded as not having taken effect, or as not existing, when that which is _antaranga_ has taken effect') first be substituted for अद् before क्त and ल्यप् afterwards for क्त.

Why do we say 'before affixes beginning with त'? Observe अद्यते 'is eaten.'

Why do we say 'before affixes having indicatory क'? Observe अत्तव्यम्.
