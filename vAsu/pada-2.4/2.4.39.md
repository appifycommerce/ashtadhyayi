sutra: बहुलं छन्दसि
vRtti: छन्दसि विषये बहुलमदो घस्लृ आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the _chhandas_ (Vedas), घस्लृ is diversely substituted for अद्.

घस्तान्नूनम् । सग्धिश्चने । (_Yajur_ _Veda_ _Vaj_ _S_.XVIII. 9). Sometimes it does not take place; as आतामद्य मध्यतो भेद उद्भृतम्

The word बहुलं is used in this _sutra_ and the word अन्यतरस्याम् in the next. There is evidently difference between the senses of these words; otherwise _Panini_ would not have employed them in such juxtaposition, had they been synonymous. For then the anuvritti of बहुलं in the next _sutra_ would have been sufficient. The following verse indicates that difference.

क्वचित् प्रवृत्तिः क्वचिदप्रवृत्तिः, क्वचिदविभाषा क्वचिदन्यदेव ।
विधेर्विधानं बहुधा समीक्ष्य, चातुर्विध बाहुलकं वदन्ति ॥

'Sometimes they are, where there is no express rule for their application; sometimes they are not applied, in spite of an express rule for their application; sometimes they are optionally employed or not, and sometimes there is some other result, licence permitted by the rule.' Thus in घस्ताम् there is not elision of the penultimate.
