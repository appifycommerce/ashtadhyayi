sutra: लुङि च
vRtti: लुङि च परतो हनो वध इत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And when लुङ् (Aorist) follows, वध् is the substitute of हन्.

अवधीत् 'he killed,' अवधीष्टाम् 'they two killed.' The division of this aphorism from the last _sutra_ (_yoga_-_vibhaga_) indicates that the next rule applies to Aorist only and not to Benedictive as well. There is no option in Benedictive _Atmanepada_.
