sutra: ण्यक्षत्रियार्षञितो यूनि लुगणिञो
vRtti: ण्यान्तात् क्षत्रियगोत्रात् आर्षादञितश्च परयोरणिञोर्यूनि लुग् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a word ending with the _Gotra_ affix ण्य (IV. 1. 151) and after a _Gotra_ word denoting the descendant of a _Kshatriya_ or a _Rishi_ (seer), and after a word a word ending with a _Gotra_ affix having an indicatory ञ्, the affix अण् and इञ् employed in forming युवन् (IV. 1. 163) descendants, are elided by the substitution of लुक् ॥

1. Thus by _sutra_ (4.1.151) (the affix ण्य comes after कुरु &c., in denoting descendent) we get कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः (7.2.117) 'a grandson of _Kuru_.' This is a _Gotra_ word (4.1.162). Now in forming a word denoting a lower descendent than grandson, we add a _Yuvan_ affix. Thus कौरव्य + इञ् (4.1.95). Now this इञ् is elided by the present _sutra_, and we get the form कौरव्यः which thus means both a _Gotra_ and a _Yuvan_ (4.1.163) descendent of _Kuru_. So that कौरव्यः is the name both of the father and the son.

Now it may be objected : 'the word कौरव्यः belongs to the तिकादि class and by (4.1.154), it will take the affix फिञ्. Do we, what we may, the form will be कौरव्यायणिः (7.1.2.') To this we reply, the word कौरव्यः which we see in that list of तिक् &c., is not the word कौरव्यः which we formed by adding ण्य under rule (4.1.151); that _Tikadi_ word is formed by adding ण्य under rule (4.1.172), and is confined to _Kshatriya_. The कौरव्यः which we have taken, denotes a _Brahmin_ _Gotra_ formed by (4.1.151).

2. Now to give an example of a word denoting the descendent of a _Kshatriya_. We take (4.1.114.) which tells us that 'the affix अण् may be added to the words which are the names of _Rishis_, or of persons belonging to the family of _Andhaka_, or _Vrishinis_ or _Kuru_.' The _Andhaka_ family, is a _Kshatriya_ family, and श्वफल्कः is a person of that family. Then श्वफल्क + अङ् = श्वाफल्कः 'a descendent of _Svaphalka_' This is a _Gotra_ descendent. In forming _Yuvan_ descendent we have श्वाफल्क + इञ्. Now this इञ् must be elided by the present _sutra_. So that श्वाफल्कः means both father and the son.

3. Now to give an example of _Rishis_ family. The _sutra_ last mentioned (4.1.114.) will also hold here. We take the word वसिष्टः; and वसिष्ट + अण् = वासिष्ठः; the _Yuvan_ affix इञ् will similarly be elided after his; and thus the word वासिष्ठः means both the father and the son.

4. Then to take the example of _Gotra_ word formed by affixes having indicatory ञ्. Thus _sutra_ (4.1.104.) declares 'the affix अञ् comes after the words विद् &c., in denoting _Gotra_ descendents.' Thus विद + अञ् = वैदः; Then add इञ् to denote _Yuvan_ descent, and we have वैदः + इञ्. By the present rule this इञ् is elided and thus we have वैदः both for the father and the son.

The above examples show the elision of the affix इञ्. Now we shall give example of the elision of the affix अण्. Now rule (4.1.154) says 'the affix फिञ् comes after the words तिक् &c., in denoting descendent.' Thus तिक + फिञ् = तैकायनिः (7.1.2.) Then to form the _Yuvan_ descended we add अण् by (4.1.83). Thus तैकायनि + अण्. By the present _sutra_, this अण् is elided, and we have तैकायनिः both applicable to the father and the son. Other examples can be multiplied.

Why do we say 'there is elision only after these words'? The _Yuvan_ affix will not be elided after other words. Thus rule (4.1.112) says:- 'The affix अण् comes after शिव &c., in forming _Gotra_. कौहड + अण् = कौहड. Now this is neither a word formed by ण्य nor is it the name of a _Kshatriya_ or a _Rishi_; nor any affix having ञ goes to form it. Therefore the _Yuvan_ affix इञ् will not be elided after this. Thus कौहड + इञ् (4.1.95) कौहडिः 'son of _Kauhada_.'

Why do we say 'affix denoting _Yuvan_ descendent is elided'? An affix not denoting a _Yuvan_ descendent will not be elided. Thus the pupils of वामरथ्य are called वामरथ्याः which word is thus formed: वामरथ + ण्य = वामरथ्यः 'a descendent of _Vamaratha_' (4.1.115). Then to denote pupils we add अण् by (4.2.111). Thus वामरथ्य + अण् = वामरथ्यः 'a pupil of _Vamarathya_.'

Why do we say '_Yuvan_ affix अण् and इञ् are elided'? The other _Yuvan_ affixes under similar circumstances are not elided. Thus the _Yuvan_ descendent of दाक्षि (grandson of दक्ष) will be दाक्षायणः Here the affix फक् (4.1.101) is not elided.

Vart:- All _Yuvan_ affixes are elided after _Gotra_ words not denoting Brahmin _Gotras_; as वौधिः applies equally to father and son; जाबालिः father, जाबालिः son; औदुम्बरिः father, औदुम्बरिः son; भाण्डीजङ्घेः father, भाण्डीजङ्घेः son. Here, first इङ् is added by (4.1.173), then फक् to denote _Yuvan_ descendent. Then this फक् is elided by the present _Vartika_.
