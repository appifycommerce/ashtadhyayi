sutra: जातिरप्राणिनाम्
vRtti: जातिवाचिनां शब्दानां द्वन्द्व एकवद्भवति प्राणिनो वर्जयित्वा ॥
vRtti_eng: A _Dvandva_ compound of words signifying _jati_ (genus) which are not names of living beings, is singular.

---
Thus आराशस्त्रि 'the probe and the knife'; धानाशष्कुलि 'fried rice and barley cake.'

Why do we say 'words denoting genus'? Observe नन्दकपाञ्चजन्यौ '_Nandaka_ and _Panchajanya_.'

Why do we say 'not of living'? See ब्रह्मणक्षत्रियौ '_Brahmanas_ and the _Kshatriyas_.'

This rule applies to the _jati_ or genus names of substances (द्रव्यजाति) and not the _jati_ names of qualities and actions. (गुणक्रियाजाति), Thus रूपरसगन्धस्पर्शाः 'colour, savour, odour, and tangibility'; गमनाकुञ्चनप्रसारणानि 'going, contraction and expansion.'

Even with _jati_ names of substances, the _Dvandva_ compound takes singular, only when the objects are spoken of collectively as a class; when, however, the individuals belonging to a class are indicated, the proper number should be employed; as, इह कुण्डे बदरामलकानि तिष्ठन्ति 'in this bowl are the _badari_ and _amalaki_ fruits.'

The words जाति 'genus,' द्रव्य 'substance,' गुण 'quality' and क्रिया 'action' are technical terms of Indian Logicians. _jati_ has already been explained. Substances are nine : earth, water, light, air, ether, time, space, soul, and mind. Qualities are twenty-four: colour, savour, odour tangibility, number, dimension, severalty, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, weight, fluidity, viscidity, sound, understanding, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit and faculty. There are five actions: throwing upwards, throwing downwards, contraction, expansion, and going.
