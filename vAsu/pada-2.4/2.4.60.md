sutra: इञः प्राचाम्
vRtti: गोत्रे य इञ् तदन्ताद्यु वद्रत्ययस्व लुग् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a word ending with the _Gotra_ affix इञ् (IV. 1. 95) there is _luk_-elision of the _Yuvan_ affix, when the _Gotra_ of the people called _Prachya_ (Eastern) is denoted.

पान्नागर + इञ् = पान्नागारिः 'the _Gotra_ descendent of _Pannagara_'; after this the _Yuvan_ affix फक (4.1.101) is elided by the present rule, and so पान्नागारिः is both the father and the son. So मान्यरैषणिः father and son. The word प्राचाम् here qualifies the word _Gotra_ understood and does not show that it is an optional rule in the opinion of Eastern Grammarians. When the _Gotra_ of _Prachyas_ is not denoted, there is no elision. Thus दाक्षिः and दाक्षायणः 'son of _Dakshi_.'
