sutra: विशिष्टलिङ्गो नदी देशोऽग्रामाः
vRtti: विशिष्टलिङ्गानां भिन्नलिङ्गानां नदीवाचिनां शब्दानां देशवाचिनां च ग्रामवर्जितानां द्वन्द्व एकवद्भति ॥
vRtti_eng: A _Dvandva_ compound of words of different genders, denoting names of rivers and countries, but not of towns, is singular.

Thus गंगाशोणम् 'the Ganges and the _Sona_. कुरवः + कुरुक्षेत्रं = कुरुकुरुक्षेत्रं 'the country of the _Kurus_ and the _Kurukshetra_.' उद्ध्यैरावती कुरुकुरु जाङ्गलम् ॥

Why do we say 'of different genders'? Observe गंगायमुने 'the _Gangas_ or and the _Yamuna_.' Both being feminine gender, so also मद्रकेकयाः ॥

Why do we say 'rivers and countries'? Observe कुक्कुटमयुर्यौ 'the hen and the pea-hen.'

Why do we say 'not of a town'? See जाम्बबशालूकिन्यौ '_Jambaba_ and _Salukini_, which are the names of two villages or _grama_.

We have taken the word 'river,' as the word 'country' does not include 'river.' So also 'mountains' are not included; as कैलासगन्धमादने 'the _Kailasa_ and the _Gandbamadana_.'

Vart:- The prohibition extends to villages and towns (_grama_) but not to cities, (_Nagara_), as मथुरापाटलिपुत्रं 'the cities of _Mathura_ and _Pataliputra_.'

Vart:- When a compound consists of two words, one a town and the other a city, the prohibition applies; as सौर्यकेतवते 'the city of _Saurya_ and the village of _Ketavata_.'
