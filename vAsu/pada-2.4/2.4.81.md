sutra: आमः
vRtti: आमः परस्य लेर्लुग् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "There is _luk_-elision in the room of that tense-affix (लि) which comes after आम् of the Perfect."
---
आम् is used in forming Periphrastic Perfect ईहांचक्रे 'he endeavoured.' Here, after the verb ईहाम् all tense-affixes are elided, and the Perfect of कृ is added to form its Perfect. Similarly ऊहांचक्रे, ईक्षांचक्रे ॥
