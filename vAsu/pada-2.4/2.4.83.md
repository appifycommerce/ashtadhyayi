sutra: नाव्ययीभावादतोऽम्त्वपञ्चम्याः
vRtti: अदन्तादव्ययीभावादुत्तरस्य सुपो न लुग् भवति, अमादेशस्तु तस्य सुपौ भवत्यपञ्चम्याः ॥
vRtti_eng: There is not _luk_-elision of the case-affix after an _Avyayi_-_bhava_ compound that ends in अ, आम्, is the substitute of its case-affixes, but not went it is the fifth case-affix.

This debars _luk_-elision which was to have taken place by the last _sutra_ instead of _luk_-elision, we have आम् added to the words ending in short अ; for examples of this, see _sutra_ (II. 1. 6); as उपकुम्भं तिष्ठति '_upakumbha_ is standing'; उपकुम्भं पश्य 'see the _upakumbha_.'

Why do we say 'after words ending in short अ'? Because after _Avyayibhava_ compound ending in any other vowels there is not substitution, but there is total-elision of the case-affixes; as अधिस्त्री, अधिकुमारी.

But the ablative case-affix is not elided after _Avyayibhava_ compound ending in short अ, nor is there the अम् substitution; as उपकुम्भादानय.
