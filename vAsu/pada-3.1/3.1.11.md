sutra: कर्त्तुः क्यङ् सलोपश्च
vRtti: उपमानात्कर्त्तुः सुबन्तादाचारेऽर्थे वा क्यङ् प्रत्ययो भवति, सकारस्य च लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्यङ् is optionally employed in the sense of behaving, after a word ending in a case-affix, denoting the object of comparison of the agent; and there is elision (_lopa_) of the final स of the noun; if it ends with a स.

Thus, श्येनेवाचरति काकः, श्येनायते, 'the crow behaves like a hawk'; अप्सरायते 'she behaves like an _Apsara_'; पयस्यते or पयायते 'it becomes milk'; (श्येन + य = श्येना + य = श्येनाय, (VII. 4. 25)).

In the words ओजस् — औजायते, and अप्सरस् — अप्सरायते the final स् is invariably elided when forming the denominative verb : but not so in the case of पयस् where the elision is optional, as पयायते or पयस्यते.

The elision of स् refers to the final स् and not when it is followed by any vowel. Thus हंस – हंसायते; सारस – सारसायते; here the स is not elided as it is not final. See. (I. 1. 52).

Vart:- After the words अवगल्भ, क्लीब, and होड, the affix क्विप् is optionally added in the sense of behaving like some one or some thing. As अवगल्भते or अवगल्भायते, क्लीबते or क्लीबायते, होडते or होडायते. The alternative forms are derived by the affixing of _kyan_.

Vart:- According to the opinion of some Grammarians, the affix क्विप् comes optionally in this sense after all crude nouns. As अश्वति or अश्वायते, गर्दभति or गर्दभायते.
