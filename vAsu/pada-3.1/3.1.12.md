sutra: भृशादिभ्यो भुव्यच्वेर्लोपश्च हलः
vRtti: भृश इत्येवमादिभ्यः प्रातिपदिकेभ्योऽच्वन्तेभ्यो भुवि भवत्यर्थे क्यङ् प्रत्ययो भवति, हलन्तानां च लोपः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्यङ् in the sense of becoming what the thing previously was not, is employed after the crude forms भृश् and the rest, which do not end with the affix च्वि (V. 4. 50); and there is elision (_lopa_) of the final consonant of these words, if they end in a consonant.

Thus, अभृशो भृशो भवति = भृशायते 'he becomes much (from a little)'; शीघ्रायते 'he becomes swift (from being tardy)'. All these roots will be _Atmanepadi_ (I.3.12).

The phrase अच्वेः 'not ending in the adverbial affix ई', refers to every one of the words belonging to the class भ्रिशादि. It may be objected, what was the necessity of adding this condition, since the affix च्वि itself denotes that something has become what it was not before; and therefore a word which has taken the affix च्वि, will not again take क्यङ् in that very sense. The repetition of च्वि here shows that the words भृश् &c. never take the affix च्वि, in the sense of 'something becoming what it was not before'. Thus the present _sutra_ is an exception to _sutra_ (V. 4.50) which ordains च्वि.
