sutra: आनाय्योऽनित्ये
vRtti: आनाय्य इति निपात्यते अनित्येऽभिधेये । नयतेराङ् पूर्वाण्ण्यदायादेशौ निपात्येते ॥
vRtti_eng: The word आनाय्यः is irregularly formed when meaning 'impermanent'.

---
This word is thus formed:- आङ् + नी + ण्यत् = आ + नै + य = आनाय्य, (the ऐ being changed into आय् by the analogy of (VI. I. 79)).

As आनाय्यो दक्षिणाग्निः. This is a species of _Dakshiņagni_ fire. As this fire is brought from the _Garhapatya_ fire and is not permanently kept alive, therefore it is called _anayya_. This however, is not co-extensive with _Dakshiņagni_. It is that fire which is brought from the _Garhapatya_, and has the same source with the _Dakshiņagni_ and _Ahavaniyagni_. A _Dakshinagni_ fire may be taken from different sources, as from the family of a well-to-do _Vaishya_, or from a frying place, or from _Garhapatya_ fire. When it is taken from the last i. e. from _Garhapatya_ fire, it is _anayya_ _Dakshiņagni_. _Ahavaniya_ is also taken from _Garhapatya_.

It is not everything, that is not lasting, which is called _anayya_ ; for a fragile pot will not be called so. It applies only to the consecrated fire. When it has not this sense, the form is आनेय meaning 'what ought to be brought'.
