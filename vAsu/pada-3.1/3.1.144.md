sutra: गेहे कः
vRtti: ग्रहेर्धातोः कप्रत्ययो भवति गेहे कर्त्तरि ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क is employed after the verb ग्रह when the agent so expressed denotes a house.

Thus ग्रह + क (VI. I. 16) = गृहम् 'a house'. The र is changed into ॠ by the rule of _samprasarana_. The plural form गृहाः means 'wife', as she is especially the person that constitutes the house; while the plural of गृहं meaning 'house' will be गृहाणि.
