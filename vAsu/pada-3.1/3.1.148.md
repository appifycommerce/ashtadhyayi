sutra: हश्च व्रीहिकालयोः
vRtti: जहातेर्जिहीतेश्च धातोर्ण्युट् प्रत्ययो भवति व्रीहौ काले च कर्त्तरि ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb हा, also the affix ण्युट् is employed when the agent so expressed denotes 'rice' and 'time'.

---
The verb हा denotes two verbs हाक 'to abandon' and हाङ् 'to go' both belonging to the Third Conjugation, forming जहाति and जिहीते as 3rd per. sing. Thus हा + ण्युट् = हायनः 'a kind of rice' (that which _jahati_ 'leaves off' all water) हायनः 'a year' (that which jihite 'goes through' all conditions.)

The accents are however different in the two. In one case the _udatta_ is on the middle; in the other, on the last.
