sutra: विदाङ्कुर्वन्त्वित्यन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: विदांकुर्वन्त्वित्येतदन्यतरस्याम् निपात्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The form विदांकुर्वन्तु is optionally employed as an irregular form.

---
This irregular form is obtained by adding the affix आम् to the root विद् 'to know,' when followed by लोट् or the Imperative tense; the tense-affixes of लोट् are then elided by _luk_; moreover there is no substitution of _guna_ as required by (VII. 3. 86); and when we have thus obtained the form विदाम्, we annex to it the लोट् of the verb कृ; thus we have विदाङ्कुर्वन्तु or विदन्तु 'let them know'. The third person plural is not only intended to be spoken of by the employment of the form विदाङ्कुर्वन्तु in the aphorism; on the contrary, the word इति shows that all the numbers and persons of the Imperative may be so employed; as विदाङ्करोतु विदाङ्कुरुताम् &c.
