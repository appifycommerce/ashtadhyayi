sutra: अचः कर्मकर्त्तरि
vRtti: अजन्ताद्धातोः परस्य च्लेः कर्मकर्तरि तशब्दे परतश्चिणादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: चिण् is optionally the substitute of च्लि when त, the third person singular of the _Atmanepada_ follows, after a root which ends with a vowel, and when the object itself is spoken of as the agent.

A reflective verb is one in which the object is spoken of as the agent. In reflective verbs therefore, चिण् is employed after roots ending in vowels; as अकारि कटः स्वयमेव 'the mat became made of itself. This is an optional rule (प्राप्तविभाषा). Therefore we have also अकृत कटः स्वयमेव; similarly अलावि or अलविष्ट केदारः स्वयमेव 'the embankment broke of itself.

But in verbs other than those that end in vowels, i.e. in those which end with a consonant, the चिण् is obligatory in the reflective voice, and not optional; as अभेदि काष्ठम् स्वयमेव 'the wood split of itself'. So also in verbs other than reflexives; as अकारि कटो देवदत्तेन.
