sutra: तनादिकृञ्भ्यः उः
vRtti: तनु विस्तारे, इत्येवमादिभ्यो धातुभ्यः कृञश्च उप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix उ comes after the roots of the _Tanadi_ class and after the verb कृ 'to make' when a _sarvadhatuka_ affix follows, signifying the agent.

This debars शप्. As तन् + उ + ति = तनोति 'he expands'; कृ + उ + ति = करोति 'he makes'. Though the root कृ is included in the list of the _Tanadi_verbs, for which see _Dhatupatha_, yet its separate enunciation in the present _sutra_ is for the sake of making a restrictive rule with regard to this verb; that is to say, the root कृ is a _Tanadi_root only for the purposes of taking the affix उ; all the other operations of _Tanadi_verbs are not to be performed upon it. Thus the rule (II. 4.79.) does not apply to कृ. Thus अकृत and अकृत्याः; the सिच् elision being compulsory and not optional.
