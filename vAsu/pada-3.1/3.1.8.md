sutra: सुप आत्मनः क्यच्
vRtti: इषिकर्मण एषितुरेवात्मसंबन्धिनः सुबन्तादिच्छायामर्थे वा क्यच् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्यच् is optionally employed, in the sense of wishing, after a word ending in a case-affix expressing the object wished as connected with the wisher's self.

---
This forms the Denominative verbs, i.e., verbs derived from nominal bases. As, पुत्र 'son', पुत्रीयति 'he wishes for a son of his own' (पुत्र + क्यच् = पुत्री + य = पुत्रीय) (II. 4. 71), (VII. 4. 33).

Why do we use the word सुप् ? The affix should not come after a whole sentence, but only after the particular word ending in the case-affix. Thus in महान्तं पुत्रमिच्छति, the affix comes only after पुत्रम् and not महान्तं पुत्रं.

Why do we say _atmanah_ ? Observe राज्ञः पुत्रमिच्छति 'he wishes a son for the king'. Here there is no affixing as the wishing is for another and not for one's own self.

The क in क्यच् is for the sake of classing _kyach_, _kyan_ and _kyash_ in one common group by simply using the word क्य, as in _sutra_ तः क्ये (I. 4. 15); while च् distinguishes _kyach_ from _kyan_ &c., and is not for the sake of accent, the affix will be _udatta_ by (III. 1. 3).

Vart:- In affixing _kyach_, prohibition must be stated of pronouns in म् and of Indeclinables. Thus in इदमिच्छति, उच्चैरिच्छति, there is no affixing.

Vart:- In the Vedas, the affix is added even when the wish is with regard to another. As मा त्वा वृका अघायवो विदन्. Here अघायु (pl. अघायवः) is formed by _kyach_, अ being added by (III.2.170), and आ is added by (VII.4. 37). See Rig Veda (I. 120.7; 27.3) &c.
