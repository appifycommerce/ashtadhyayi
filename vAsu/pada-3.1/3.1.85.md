sutra: व्यत्ययो बहुलम्
vRtti: यथायथं विकरणाः शबादयो विहितास्तेषां छन्दसि विषये बहुलं व्यत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the _Chhandas_ there is diversely an interchange of the various _vikaranas_ शप् and the rest which have been previously ordained under special circumstances.

The word व्यत्यय means transgression of the fixed rule, or interchange, taking of two _vikaraņas_ at a time, and so on. Thus भेदति  = भिद + शप् + ति) instead of भिनत्ति from the root भिद 'to split', belonging to the _Rudhadi_ class; e.g. शुष्मस्य आण्डानि भेदति (_Rig_. VIII. 40. II.) 'He (_Indra_) break the eggs (children) of _Shushma_; so also, जरसा मरते पतिः (_Rig_. X. 86. II); here there is मरते = (मृ + शप् + ते) instead of म्रियते; the root मृ belonging to the _Tudadi_ class. So also there are two _vikaraņas_ at one and the same time, in the following. इन्द्रो वस्ते न नेषतु 'May _Indra_ lead by this abode' ; here there is नेषतु 3rd. per. sing. of the Imperative लोट् of the root नो 'to lead' ; there are two _vikaraņas_ सिप् and शप् instead of नयतु = (नी +शप् + त्); इन्द्रेण युजा तरुषेम वृत्रम् (_Rig_. VII. 48. I). The word तरुषेम (तृ + उ + सिप् + शप् + अम) is the Ist. per. sing. of the )Optative (लिङ्) of the root तृ, the classical form being तरेम or तीर्याम 'may we cross'.

In the Vedic literature we have many apparent irregularities with regard to the rules of declension of nouns, conjugation of verbs, application of _Parasmaipada_ or _Atmanepada_ affixes; rules of gender, person or tense, rules of interchange of consonants, or of vowels, rules of accent, rules relating to कृत् and तद्धित affixes and rules relating to the affixes included in the _pratyahara_ यङ् (III. I. 22) to (III. I. 86).
