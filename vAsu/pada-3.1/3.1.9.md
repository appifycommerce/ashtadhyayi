sutra: काम्यच्च
vRtti: सुबन्तात्कर्मणा आत्मनेच्छायां काम्यच् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And the affix काम्यच् is also employed, in the sense of wishing, after a word ending in a case-affix, expressing the object wished as connected with the wisher's self.

Thus, पुत्रकाम्यति 'he wishes for a son of his own'.

The making of this a separate _sutra_ instead of adding it with the last aphorism and making one _sutra_ of them both, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_, where the _anuvritti_ of _kyach_ only runs, and not that of _kamyach_. The क of _kamyach_ is not indicatory, but is a part of the real affix. Here, therefore, rule (I.3.8) which would have made the letter क indicatory, does not apply; because no particular purpose would be served by making indicatory. Or the affix _kamyach_ may be considered to have an indicatory च before it i.e. the affix being _chakamya_.
