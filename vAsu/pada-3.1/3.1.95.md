This defines the class of affixes known as _kritya_, a subdivision of _krit_ affixes. These are certain affixes like तव्य, अनीय &c, which may be treated as declinable verbal terminations. (III. 4. 70). The following 38 _sutras_ treat of these affixes. These verbal adjectives correspond in meaning to the Latin participles in _udus_ conveying the idea that the action expressed by the verbs ought to be done or will be done. The word formed by them may be called Passive Potential Participles or Future Passive Participles. The illustrations will be given hereafter under each affix as taught. The word _kritya_ occurs in _sutras_ (II. I. 33), (II. 3. 71) &c.
