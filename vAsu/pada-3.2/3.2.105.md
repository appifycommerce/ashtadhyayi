sutra: छन्दसि लिट्
vRtti: छन्दसि विषये धातोर्लिट् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the _Chhandas_, the affix लिट् comes after a verb with a past signification.

As अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श 'I saw the sun from both sides'; अहं द्यावापृथिवी आततान 'I stretched the heaven and the earth'. Here the words ददर्श and आततान have the force of _nishtha_. See _Yaj_. _Ved_. (VIII. 9).

Why this separate _sutra_, when by aphorism (III. 4. 61), in the _Chhandas_ the _lun_, _lan_ and _lit_ come in all tenses ? That rule is made with regards to two or more verbs when in syntactical relation (धातुसम्बन्ध) with each other (III. 4. 1). The present rule is general, and without any such limitations.

_Lit_ is the affix of the Present Perfect and will be fully treated of in the conjugation of verbs.
