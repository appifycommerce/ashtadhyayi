sutra: लिटः कानज्वा
vRtti: छन्दसि लिटः कानजादेशो भवति वा ॥
vRtti_eng: In the _Chhandas_ the affix लिट् is optionally replaced by the affix कानच् ।

As अग्निं चिक्यानः 'he consecrated the fire'; सोमं सुषुवाणः 'he pressed the _soma_ juice'. This being an optional affix, is sometimes not employed; as in the examples in the last aphorism.

Why has the word _lit_ been repeated in this _sutra_, when its _anuvritti_ could have been drawn from the last _sutra_ ? The substitute कानच् replaces not only the special लिट् of _sutra_ (III. 2. 105), but the general लिट् which comes after the roots in forming the perfect tense; so that the affix कानच् forms verbal adjectives as well as the perfect tense.

This affix comes after those verbs only which take _Atmanepada_ terminations. See (I. 4. 100). तूतुजान (_Rig_. _Ved_. (I. 3. 6)).
