The _anuvritti_ of the word _anadyatana_ which had come to a stop with (III. 2. 120) manifests itself again in this _sutra_ by a process of jumping over the two intermediate aphorisms. This sort of _anuvritti_ is technically called _manduka_-_pluti_ 'the leap of a frog' i. e. skipping of several _sutras_ and supplying a word from a previous _sutra_.

This is an optional rule, so that when _lat_ and _lun_ are not used, the proper tenses, as the case may be, must be employed. As वसन्तीह पुरा छात्राः 'the pupils lived here formerly'. So also, Aorist, अवात्सुः पुरा छात्राः; Imperfect, अवसन्निह पुरा छात्राः; Perfect, ऊषुरिह पुरा छात्राः ।

Why do we say 'when the word स्म is not used'? Observe यजति स्म पुरा युधिष्टिरः '_Yudhishthira_ did perform a sacrifice formerly'. Here rule 118 _ante_ exerts its influence.
