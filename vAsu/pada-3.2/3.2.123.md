sutra: वर्तमाने लट्
vRtti: आरब्धोऽपरिसमाप्तश्च वर्त्तमानस्तस्मिन् वर्त्तमानेऽर्थे वर्त्तमानाद्धातोर्लट्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix लट् comes after a verb when denoting a present action.

The word वर्तमान means that which is begun and which has not yet come to an end. The action denoted by a verb in the present tense is yet continuing and has not stopped. As पचति 'he is cooking'; पठति 'he is reading'. So also whatever is constant, regular, uniform, is represented by the Present Indefinite. As तिष्ठन्ति पर्वताः 'the mountains stand'; स्रवन्ति नद्यः 'the rivers flow'.
