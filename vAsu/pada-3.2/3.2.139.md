sutra: ग्लाजिस्थश्च क्स्नुः
vRtti: ग्ला जि स्था इत्येतेभ्यो धातुभ्यश्चाकाराद् भुवश्च तच्छीलादिषु क्स्नुः प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्स्नु comes after the following verbs in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit &c.' viz.- ग्ला 'to be weary', जि 'to conquer' and स्था 'to stand', as well as after भू 'to be'.

As, ग्लास्नुः 'languid'; जिष्णुः 'victorious'; स्थास्नुः 'disposed to stand firm, immoveable'; भूष्णुः 'being'.

The _anuvritti_ of the word _Chhandasi_ does not extend to this _sutra_. The indicatory letter of this affix is really ग and not क, and therefore, there is no substitution of long ई for the आ of स्था, which would otherwise have taken place, had the affix been कित् (VI. 4. 66).

In the _sutra_ (l. 1. 5.) (क्ङिति च) the letter ग is also included; for ग coming before क, is changed by the rules of _sandhi_ into क and is not therefore visible. This affix therefore does not cause _guna_.

So also in _sutra_ (VII. 2. II) (श्रयुकः किति), the augment इट् does not come after the verb स्नु, or a monosyllabic verb ending in the _pratyahara_ उक, when an affix having an indicatory क follows. Here also क includes ग; and therefore in भूष्णु we have no intermediate augment इट्.

Vart:- In the _Chhandas_ this affix comes after the verb दंश 'to bite'; as दङ्क्ष्णवः पशवः 'the beasts that bite'.
