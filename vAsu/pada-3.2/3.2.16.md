sutra: चरेष्टः

The word _adhikarana_ of the last _sutra_ is understood in this. As कुरुषु चरति = कुरुचरः 'who goes among the _Kurus_'. मद्रचरः 'who goes among the Madras'.

Of the affix ट the real affix is अ, the letter ट being indicatory, showing that the feminine of these words is formed by the affix ङीप्. (See. (IV. 1. 14)), as कुरुचरी, मद्रचरी ।
