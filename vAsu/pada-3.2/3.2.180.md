sutra: विप्रसंभ्यो ड्वसंज्ञायाम्
vRtti: वि प्र सम् इत्येवं पूर्वार्द्धवतेर्धातोः डुप्रत्ययो भवति न चेत् संज्ञा गम्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix डु comes after the verb भू when it is preceded by the _upasargas_ वि, प्र and सम् provided that the word to be formed does not mean an appellative.

As विभुः 'all pervading'; प्रभुः 'lord'; सम्भुः 'Creator'.

Why do we say 'when it is not a proper name'? Observe विभूः 'a person called _Vibhu_'.

Vart:- The words मितद्रु &c, also are formed by this affix. As मितद्रु 'the sea'; शम्भुः 'causing happiness'.

Why have we applied डु and not क्विप् to this root, as the forms would have been the same in either case? We have done so for two purposes: (1) To prevent the rules relating to _dhatus_ from applying to this. (2) To prevent the insertion of तुक् augment. Thus the Ist. dual of मितद्रु is मितद्रू, Ist. pl. is मितद्रवः । Here there is no substitution of उकङ् which the rule (VI. 4. 77) required, if द्रु had retained its _dhatu_ characteristic; so also this rule of accent in (VI. 1. 175) does not apply to Instrumental sing. मितद्र्वा &c, (2.) We have no त् which rule (VI. I. 71) required. मितं द्रवति = मितद्रुः ।
