sutra: ञीतः क्तः
vRtti: ञीतो धातोर्वर्तमानेऽर्थे क्तप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The verbal roots, marked with an indicatory ञि, take the affix क्त, in denoting the present time.

The _Nishtha_ affix क्त, as a general rule, is a past participial affix and denotes past time; and is so ordained by rule (III 2.102). The present _sutra_ thus makes an exception in case of those verbs which are marked with an indicatory ञि in the _Dhatupatha_; as ञिमिदा 'to be affectionately inclined'; मिन्नः (मिद् + क्त = मिङ् + त = मिन् + न (VIII. 2. 42) 'being affectionately inclined'. So ञिक्षिवदा – क्ष्विणः 'sounding inarticulately'; ञिधृषा – धृष्टः 'bold'. The _anuvritti_ of वर्तमाने 'in the sense of the present', is read into this _sutra_ from (III. 2. 123).
