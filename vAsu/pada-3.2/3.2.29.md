sutra: नासिकास्तनयोर्ध्माधेटोः
vRtti: नासिकास्तनयोः कर्मणोरुपपदयोर्ध्माधेटोर्धात्वोः खश्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix खश् comes after the verbs ध्मा 'to blow' and धे 'to suck' when नासिका 'nose' and स्तन 'breast', are in composition with them as object.

The rule of _yathasankhya_ as given in (I. 3. 10) does not however, apply here. For स्तन is compounded with धेट्; as (स्तन + धे + खश् = स्तन + मुम् + धे + शप् + खश् = स्तन + म् + धय् + अ + अ) = स्तनन्धयः 'an infant' (sucking the breast).

But नासिका is compounded with both ध्मा and धे; as नासिका + ध्मा + खश् = नासिक + म् + धम + अ (VI. 3. 66) and (67); (VII. 3. 78) = नासिकन्धमः 'blowing and breathing through the nose'. So also नासिकन्धयः 'drinking through the nose'.

That the rule of _yathasankhya_ does not apply here, is indicated by the irregular construction of the _Dvandva_ compound नासिकास्तनयोः. By rule (II. 2. 84.) the word स्तन containing fewer syllables ought to have stood first; one irregularity lets in another.

The feminine of स्तनन्धयः is स्तनन्धयी, as the verb धे has an indicatory ट् ।
