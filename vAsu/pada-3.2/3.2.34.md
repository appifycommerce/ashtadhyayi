sutra: मितनखे च
vRtti: मित नख इत्येतयोः कर्मणोरुपपदयोः पचेः खश्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix खश् is employed after the verb पच्, when मित 'a measured partition' or नख 'a nail' is the word in composition with it as an object.

The aphorism has its scope when the words formed do not denote measures, which was the case in the last _sutra_. Thus मितम्पचा ब्राह्ममणी 'the _Brahmani_ who cooks a little i. e. niggardly _Brahmani_'; नखम्पचा यवागूः 'the nail-scorching barley gruel'.
