sutra: आशिते भुवः करणभावयोः
vRtti: आशितशब्दे सुबन्ते उपपदे भवतेर्धातोः करणे भावे चार्थे खच् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix खच् comes after the verb भू 'to be' when in composition with the case-inflected word आशित 'satisfied by eating' and the sense is that of instrument or condition.

The word 'सुपि' of _sutra_ 4 is understood here.

Thus आशिसम्भवः meaning 'food', literally that by which one is satiated. आशिती भवती अनेन. Here the word denotes instrument. And आशितसम्भवः also means 'satiety', which denotes condition.
