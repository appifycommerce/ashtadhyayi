sutra: अन्तात्यन्ताध्वदूरपारसर्वानन्तेषु डः
vRtti: अन्त अत्यन्त अध्वन् दूर पार सर्व अनन्त इत्येतेषु कर्मसूपपदेषु गमेर्डप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ड comes after the verb गम् 'to go' when in composition with the following words as its objects:- अन्त 'end', अत्यन्त 'excessive', अध्वन् 'road', दूर 'far', पार 'across', सर्व 'all' and अनन्त 'endless'.

---
The _anuvritti_ of the word सञ्ज्ञायाम् does not extend to this. As अन्तगः 'having gone to the end, thoroughly conversant'; अत्यन्तगः 'going too fast'; अध्वगः 'a way-farer'; दूरगः 'going to a distant place'; पारगः 'completely familiar'; सर्वगः 'going everywhere, the Supreme Being'; अनन्तगः 'going to infinity, moving for ever'.

Of the affix ड the letter ड् is indicatory, the real affix being अ. The ड indicates that the टि portion of the word to which this is added, must be elided (VI. 4. 143); as अन्त + गम् + ड = अन्त + ग् + अ (the टि portion अम् of गम् is elided). Now though the rule (VI. 4. 143) says 'when that which has an indicatory ड, follows, there is elision of the टि of a भ'; yet in the present case, such elision takes place, although the word गम् here is not one of those called भ (l. 4. 18); because the presence of ड as an indicatory letter must not be unmeaning.

Vart:- The ड is also employed when the words in composition are सर्वत्र 'everywhere' and पन्न 'creeping'; as सर्वत्रगः 'Supreme Spirit'; पन्नगः 'snake.'

Vart:- So also when the word in composition is उरस् 'breast', and there is elision of its final. As उरस् + गम् + ड = उरगः 'moving on breast, a snake'.

Vart:- So also with the words सु 'well' and दुर् 'bad', when the resulting words denote location. As सुगः 'that in which one goes easily, easy of access'. दुर्गः 'difficult of access, a fort'.

Vart:- So also with the preposition निर्, the word to be formed meaning country; as निर्गः 'a country'.

Vart:- Others say, that this ड is added when other words besides the above stand as _upapadas_. Thus स्त्र्यगारगः (स्त्री + अगार + गम् + ड) 'who goes to the women's compartment'; ग्रामगः 'going to the village'; गुरुतल्पगः 'who pollutes the bed of his guru'.
