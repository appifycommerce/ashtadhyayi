sutra: हव्येऽनन्तःपादम्
vRtti: हव्यशब्दे उपपदे छन्दसि विषये वहेर्धातोर्ञ्युट्प्रत्ययो भवति, अनन्तःपादं चेद्बहिर्वर्त्तते ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ञ्युट् comes in the _Chhandas_, after the verb वह् 'to carry' when it is in composition with the word हव्य 'an oblation to gods', provided that the word so formed does not occur in the middle of a _pada_ (fourth part of a stanza).

---
As अग्निश्च हव्यवाहनः 'fire, the carrier of oblation to the gods'. (_Rig_. _Ved_. I. 44. 2).

When this word occurs in the middle of a _pada_, or at the beginning, the form is हव्यवाट्, which is derived by adding the affix ण्वि (_sutra_ (64)). As हव्यवाडग्निरजरः पिता नः 'the never-decaying _agni_ or fire that carries oblation to the gods, is our father'. (_Rig_. _Ved_. III. 2. 2.)
