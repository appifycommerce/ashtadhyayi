sutra: विजुपे छन्दसि
vRtti: उपउपपदे यजेश्छंदसि विषये विच्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix विच् comes after the verb यज् when उप precedes, in the _Chhandas_.

As उपयङ्भिरूर्ध्वं वहन्ति 'they carry it up with the उपयज् formulas'. उपयज् is the name of eleven formulas at a sacrifice.

The word '_Chhandas_' has been repeated here though the _anuvritti_ of the word '_mantra_' was present in it, in order to include the _Brahmana_ literature also.

The च् is indicatory and is useful in including the affix विच् in the larger group called वि (which includes क्विन्, क्विप्, ण्वि, विट्), as in the _sutra_ येरपृक्तस्य (VI. I. 67).

Why has this _sutra_ been made, since the affix विच् would have been valid even by aphorism 75? The _sutra_ has been separately made to show that it is a restrictive rule here. The form उपयज् is found in the _Chhandas_ only, and not in the ordinary literature.
