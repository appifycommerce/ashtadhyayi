sutra: स्थः क च
vRtti: स्था इत्येतस्माद्धातोः सुप्युपपदे कप्रत्ययो भवति क्विप् च ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes क and क्विप् come after the verb स्था when it is in composition with a word ending in a case-affix or an _upasarga_.

Why has this aphorism been made, when by rule (III. I. 4), स्था would have taken क and by rule (III. 1. 75), it would have taken क्विप् also? This repetition is for the purpose of prohibiting the prohibition, that is to say, the _sutra_ (III. 2. 14) prohibited the _sutra_ (III. 2. 4), and the present _sutra_ removes that prohibition. Thus शंस्थः and शंस्थाः । But for this _sutra_, this form could not have been evolved; for, with the _upapada_ शम्, the verb स्था would have taken the affix अच् by (III. 2. 14).
