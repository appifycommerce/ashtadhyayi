sutra: बहुलमाभीक्ष्ण्ये
vRtti: आभीक्ष्ण्ये गम्यमाने धातोर्बहुलं णिनिप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix णिनि comes after a verb diversely when continued repetition of an action is to be expressed.

---
The word आभीक्ष्ण्य means continued repetition, that is to say, zealous practice or assiduous performance of anything, but does not mean habit. As कषायपायिणो गान्धाराः 'the people of _Gandhara_ are _kashaya_-drinkers'. कषाय + पा + णिनि = कषाय + पा + युक् + णिनि (VII. 3. 33). So also क्षीरपायिण उशीनाराः 'the people of _Usinara_ are milk-drinkers'. सौवीर-पायिणो बाह्लीकाः 'the people of _Bahlika_ are _sauvira_-drinkers'.
 
By using the word 'diversely' in the _sutra_, this affix is not applied in other places, as in the following :- कुल्माषखादः 'a grain eater'.
