sutra: भूते
vRtti: भूत इत्यधिकारो वर्त्तमाने लङिति यावत्, यदित ऊर्द्धमनुक्रमिष्यामः भूत इत्येवं तद्वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: All the affixes to be treated of hereafter should be understood to come in the sense of past time.

The phrase 'with the sense of past time' is an _adhikara_ or governing aphorism and exerts its influence up to aphorism 123 of this chapter; that is to say, these affixes give a signification of the past tense to the verb whose _anuvritti_ is also understood throughout the subsequent _sutras_; see (III. 1. 91).

Thus it will be taught in the next aphorism: 'after the verb यज्, when the word in composition is in the instrumental case, the affix णिनि is employed'. Here to complete the sense we must read into the _sutra_, the words 'with the sense of past time'. As अग्निष्टोमेनेष्टवान् = अग्निष्टोमयाजिन् 'who has sacrificed with an _Agnishtoma_ or a five-day series of offerings'.

Why do we say 'with the sense of past time' ? Otherwise these affixes will not be employed. As अग्निष्टोमेन यजति 'he sacrifices with _Agnishtoma_'.
