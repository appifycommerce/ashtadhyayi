sutra: सुकर्मपापमंत्रपुण्येषु कृञः
vRtti: स्वादिषु कर्मसूपपदेषु करोतेर्द्धातोः क्विप्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्विप् comes after the verb कृ 'to make' with the sense of past time, when the following words in the accusative case are in composition:- सु 'well', कर्म 'action', पाप 'sin', मंत्र 'hymn' and पुण्य 'virtue'.

---
The phrase 'in the accusative case' is understood in this aphorism, and applies to all the above-mentioned words, except सु, which being an attributive word, of course, cannot take any case-terminations. As सुकृत् (VI. 1. 71) 'who has done well'; कर्मकृत् 'who has done all works'; पापकृत् 'who has committed sins'; मन्त्रकृत् 'who has made a mantra'; पुण्यकृत् 'who has done virtuous actions'.

This _sutra_ also ordains a restrictive rule or _niyama_. Three-fold restriction is intended here: namely, restrictions with regard to time, _upapada_, and affix; but not with regard to verbs. See (III. 2. 87). There being no restriction with regard to the root, this affix is employed when words other than these are _upapadas_. As, शास्त्रकृत् 'who has made Scriptures'; भाष्यकृत् 'who has made a commentary'. The त् is added to the root by (VI. 1. 71).
