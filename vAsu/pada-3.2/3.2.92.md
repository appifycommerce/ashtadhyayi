The words चेः and कर्मणि are understood in this _sutra_. The Name is expressed by taking the complete word consisting of the verbal root, the _upapada_ and the affix. As श्येनचित् 'a fire which has been arranged in the shape of a hawk'; कङ्कचित् 'fire arranged like a heron'.

The word आख्या indicates that these words are _rudhi_ words, their sense depending upon usage rather than etymology. The arrangement of bricks for sacrificial purpose with regard to fire, gets these various names; that is, when the bricks are arranged like a falcon, it is called श्येनचित्, and so on.
