sutra: कर्मणीनि विक्रियः
vRtti: कर्मण्युपपदे विपूर्वात् क्रीणातेर्धातोरिनिप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix इनि comes after the compound verb विकृ 'to sell', in the sense of past time, when in composition with a word in the accusative case.

The repetition of the word कर्मणि in the _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ might have been drawn from the last aphorism, indicates that when the object carries with it a sense of censure on the agent, then only this affix is employed and not with every and any object. As सोमविक्रयिन् 'the seller of _soma_ plant'; रसविक्रयिन् 'the seller of liquors'; employing disapproval of the action of those persons who carry on these mean professions. But not so in धान्यविक्रायः 'the seller of paddy'.
