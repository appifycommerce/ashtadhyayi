sutra: दृशेः क्वनिप्
vRtti: दृशेर्धातोः कर्मण्युपपदे क्वनिप्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्वनिप् comes after the verb दृश् 'to see' in the sense of past time, when in composition with a word in the accusative case.

As मेरुदृश्वन्, 1st. sing. मेरुदृश्वा 'who has seen the Meru'. परलोकदृश्वा 'who has seen the hereafter.'

Though the affix क्वनिप् was valid by _sutra_ (III. 2. 75) its repetition here shows that no other affix comes in this sense after this verb.
