sutra: सहे च
vRtti: सहशब्दे चोपपदे युधिकृञोर्धातोः क्वनिप्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्वनिप् comes after the verbs युध् and कृ, with a past signification, when the word सह 'with', is in composition.

The word सह, being a particle, and not denoting a substance, is incapable of taking any case. As सहयुध्वन् 'who has made to fight with'; सहकृत्वन् 'who has done any thing along with another'.
