sutra: ल्युट् च
vRtti: नपुंसकलिङ्गे भावे धातोर्ल्युट्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_lyut_' is added to the root, when the name of an action is expressed, in the neuter gender.

Thus हसनं छात्रस्य 'the laughter of the student'; शोभनं 'beauty'; जल्पनं 'speech'; शयनं 'sleep'; आसनम् 'seat'.

The separation of this _sutra_ from the last, in which it might well have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms, in which the _anuvritti_ of _lyut_ only runs, and not that of क्त ।
