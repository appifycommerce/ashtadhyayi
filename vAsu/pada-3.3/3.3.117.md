sutra: करणाधिकरणयोश्च
vRtti: करणेऽधिकरणे च कारके धातोर्ल्युट्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_lyut_' comes after a root, when the relation of the word to be formed to the verb is that of an instrument or location.

Thus इध्मप्रव्रश्चनः 'an axe' (lit. an instrument for cutting wood); '_palasa_-cutter'; गोदोहनी 'milk-pail' (a vessel into which milk is milked); so also सक्तुधानी । In other words, this affix expresses also the idea of the instrumental case (a tool), and of the locative case (a repository).
