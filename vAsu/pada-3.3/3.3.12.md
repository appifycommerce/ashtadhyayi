sutra: अण् कर्मणि च
vRtti: धातोरण्प्रत्ययो भवति भविष्यतिकाले कर्मण्युपपदे कियायां च क्रियार्थायाम् ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_an_' comes after a root with the force of the future, when the word in construction with it is in the accusative case, and when the action is performed for the sake of another action.

The word 'future' is understood here. The force of च is merely that of a connective particle. By rule (III. 2. 1.) the affix अण् comes after a root when the word in composition is in the accusative case. That is a general injunction; and the rule of वाऽसरूप not applying, the affix ण्वुल would have debarred it as already said; hence this repetition. This rule being an _apavada_ rule (an exception or a special rule with regard to those verbs which have the accusative case in composition) will thus, within its own jurisdiction, prevent the application of ण्वुल् of (III. 3. 10); and by the rule of परत्व given in (I. 4. 2), it will debar the affixes like क &c. Therefore this अण् comes after even those verbs also which were especially exempted from its operation by rules like (III. 2. 3). Thus by rule (III. 2. 3) the अण् of (III. 2. I) could not have come after simple verbs ending in long आ, such as दा 'to give' &c. But the present अण् with a gerundial force will come even after such verbs. As गोदायो व्रजति 'he goes to give cows', and not गोदः । So also कम्बलदायो व्रजति 'he goes to give blanket'; अश्वदायो व्रजति । दा + अण् = दायः (VII. 3. 33).

So also काण्डलावो व्रजति 'he goes to cut wood'. In this case अण् would have been applied even by (III. 2. 1).
