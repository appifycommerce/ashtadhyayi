sutra: अवे तॄस्त्रोर्घञ्
vRtti: अव उपपदे तरतेस्तृणातेश्च धातोः करणाधिकरणयोः संज्ञायां घञ्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ghan_' comes after the roots '_tri_' (to cross) and '_stri_' (to spread), when the _upasarga_ '_ava_' is in composition with them, and when the word so formed is an appellative related to the verb either as an instrument or as a location.

This supersedes घ । The ञ् is indicatory and causes the _vriddhi_ of ॠ (VII. 2. 115) and is also for the sake of regulating the accent (VI. 1. 195), (VI. 1. 197). The indicatory घ् is useful in the subsequent aphorism where it changes the palatals into gutturals. Thus अवतारः 'the descent (or incarnation of a diety); अवस्तारः 'a screen round a tent'.

How do we apply अवतार also in phrases like अवतारो नद्याः 'the descent of rivers', for here the word _avatara_ is not an appellative? This use is also allowed, because the _anuvritti_ of the word प्राय is understood here also; so that those words _avatara_ &c. may be employed in senses other than appellative.
