sutra: अध्यायन्यायोद्यावसंहाराधारावायाश्च
vRtti: अध्यायादयः शब्दा घञन्ता निपात्यन्ते ॥
vRtti_eng: And the words '_adhyaya_', '_nyaya_', '_udyava_', '_samhara_', '_adhara_' and '_avaya_' are anomalous.

---
These words are formed by adding the affix घञ् to the exclusion of घ which would have come by rule (III. 3. 118). All these words are derived from roots which end in vowels. Thus अधि + इ + घञ् = अध्यायः 'a chapter or book' (lit. that in which they read); नी--न्यायः 'logic, justice', (lit. that by which men are lead); उत्-यु--उद्याव: 'mixture' (lit. that in which they blend); सम्-हृ--संहारः 'destruction' (lit. by which they are destroyed); आ-धृ-आधारः 'support' (lit. in which anything is held); आ-वि--आवायः = आवयन्ति अस्मिन् ।

The force of च is to include others not enumerated above; as, अवहारः ।
