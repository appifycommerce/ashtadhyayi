sutra: उदङ्कोऽनुदके
vRtti: उदङ्क इति निपात्यते अनुदक विषयश्चेत् धात्वर्थो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word '_udanka_' is anomalous, when the sense of the root refers to subjects other than 'water'.

The word is thus formed: उत् + अञ्च + घञ् = उदङ्कः 'a vessel'.

Would not the affix घञ् have come by _sutra_ (III. 3. 121), why then this aphorism? This is made a separate aphorism in order to prohibit the application of the affix, where the word to be formed means 'water'.

Thus तैलोदङ्कः 'a leathern vessel for oil'.

Why do we say 'when not referring to 'water'? Observe उदकोदञ्चनः 'a bucket for drawing water' (उद् + अञ्च + ल्युट्).

Why do not we give the counter-example by adding the affix घ to the root उदञ्च्? Because the form evolved by applying घ, would be the same in every respect as that evolved by घञ्; even the accent would be the same. For by _sutra_ (VI. 2. 144), the _udatta_ accent, in the case of घञ्, will fall on the final.
