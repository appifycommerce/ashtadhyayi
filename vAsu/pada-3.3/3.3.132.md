sutra: आशंसायां भूतवच्च
vRtti: भविष्यति काले आशंसायां गम्यमानायां धातोर्वा भूतवत् प्रत्यया भवन्ति चकाराद् वर्त्तमानवच्च ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes which are employed, when the sense is that of the past time or of the present time, may, optionally, in like manner, be employed, after a root in denoting future time, when hope is expressed.

The word 'optionally' is understood here also. The phrase 'not remote from the present' is not valid in this aphorism. The word आशंसा means the wish or expectation of getting an object not yet obtained, and consequently this can refer only to future time. The force of च is to draw the word वर्त्तमानवत् from the last _sutra_ in this aphorism. This _sutra_ has been thus put by Mr. _Apte_:--"When hope is expressed in a conditional form, the Aorist (लुङ्), the Present, or Simple Future is used in both the clauses to denote a future time. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेदगमत् or आगतः, or आगच्छति or आगमिष्यति वा एते व्याकरणमध्यगीष्महि, or अधीतवन्तः or अधीमहे or अध्येष्यामहे 'if the teacher were to come, we should read grammar'.

This construction is possible only when the past tense is expressed by लुङ् (Aorist); and not by लङ् or लिट्. For लुङ् denotes past time in general, while लङ् and लिट् denote particular forms of past time; (see (III. 2. 110)), (III. 2. 111) and (III. 2. 115). The phrase भूतवत् making an analogy with time in general, will not therefore, refer to लिट् or लङ् which refer to past time in special.

Why say 'when hope is expressed'? Observe आगमिष्यति 'he will come'.
