sutra: वोताप्योः
vRtti: उताप्योः समर्थयोर्लिङिति वक्ष्यति प्रागेतस्मात् सूत्रावधेर्यदित ऊर्ध्वमनुक्रमिष्यामः, तत्र भूते लिङ्निमित्ते क्रियातिपत्तौ लृङ् वा भवतीत्येतदधिकृतं वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: 'From this point as far as _sutra_ (III. 3. 152) (the whole of the following sentence is to be taken as exerting a governing influence on the _sutras_ that follow: where there is a reason for affixing ''_Lin_'', the ''_Lrin_'' may be) optionally (employed in denoting past time, when the non-completion of the action is to be understood).'

All the words within brackets must be supplied from the previous _sutras_ to complete the sense. This _sutra_ consists of three words वा 'optionally', आ 'as far as' and उताप्योः (the _sutra_ (III. 3. 152)). The words वा + आ + उ form वो by the rules of conjunction. The particle आ in this aphorism has the force of limit exclusive and not that of limit inclusive. The optional use of the conditional tense will be illustrated in the following aphorisms, where, in addition to the special tenses to be employed by those rules, we may employ the conditional also under those very circumstances, in the alternative, provided that the non-completion of the action is understood. Prof. Bohtlingk translates this aphorism thus: "optionally so, in connection with उत् and अपि, the conditional tense may be employed".
