sutra: किंवृत्ते लिङ्लृटौ
vRtti: किंवृत्तउपपदे गर्हायां गम्यमानायां धातोर्लिङ्लृटौ प्रत्ययौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes '_Lin_' and '_Lrit_' come after a verb, when the interrogative words like '_kim_' &c, are in composition with it, and censure is implied.

Here also the Potential and the First Future are employed in preference to the time required by the action.

The word 'censure' is understood here; not so, however, the word 'optionally'. This excludes all other tense-affixes. The repetition of the word लिङ् in this _sutra_, is for the sake of excluding लट्, whose _anuvritti_ would also have run into this _sutra_, had we taken the _anuvritti_ of लिङ् from the last _sutra_, instead of repeating it. Thus कः कतरो वा हरिं निन्देत्, निन्दिष्यति वा 'who will censure _Hari_'?

In the Past tense, when the non-completion of action is implied, we may optionally employ the Conditional (लृङ्); and in the Future tense, under similar circumstances, we must employ the Conditional necessarily; as को नाम वृषलो यं तत्र भवानयाजयिष्यत् 'who is the _Sudra_ for whom your honor did sacrifice (in vain)'. This _sutra_ may be rendered thus also:—" In connection with an Interrogative Pronoun, when censure is implied, may be employed the Potential or the First Future".
