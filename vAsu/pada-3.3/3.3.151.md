sutra: शेषे लृडयदौ
vRtti: शेषेउपपदे चित्रीकरणे गम्यमाने धातोर्लृट्प्रत्ययो भवति यदिशब्दश्चेन्न प्रयुज्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: In all other cases, when wonder is implied by other words than '_yachcha_' and '_yatra_', the affix '_Lrit_' is employed after a root, except when the word '_yadi_' is used.

---
In all other cases, that is to say, in cases where the words यच्च or यत्र are not employed, as well as where the word यदि is not used, the First Future is used in preference to the Potential.

Thus आश्चर्यं, चित्रं, अद्भूतम् अन्धो नाम पर्वतमारोक्ष्यति, बधिरो नाम व्याकरणम् अध्येष्यते 'it is wonderful, strange and astonishing that the blind man should ascend a mountain, or a deaf person should read grammar'.

Not so, when the word यदि is employed. Thus आश्चर्यं यदि सोऽधीयीत 'a wonder, if he study'. आश्चर्यं यदि स भुञ्जीत 'a wonder, if he eat'.

As there is, in this case, no occasion to employ the Potential, we cannot employ the Conditional as directed in _sutras_ (III. 3. 139), (III. 3. 140) and (III. 3. 141).
