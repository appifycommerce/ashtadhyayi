sutra: कालसमयवेलासु तुमुन्
vRtti: कालादिषूपपदेषु धातोस्तुमुन्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_tumun_' comes after a root, when the words '_kala_', '_samaya_', and '_vela_' (all meaning time) are in composition.

Thus कालो भोक्तुम् 'time to eat'; समयः खलु स्नानभोजने सेवितुम् 'it is time to bathe and take food'; वेला भोक्तुम् 'time to eat'. In short, Infinitive in तुमुन् may be used with words meaning 'time'; as अवसरोऽयमात्मानं प्रकाशयितुम् 'this is, indeed, the time to show myself'.

Why do not we use the Infinitive here? कालः पचति भूतानि 'time devours all creatures'. The sense of 'direction &c'. is understood in the _sutra_; so when 'direction &c' is not meant, the Infinitive will not be used.

Why do not we use the Infinitive here, कालो भोजनस्य 'proper time to eat'? Because, by the rule of non-uniform affixes (III. 1. 94), we can use also the affix ल्युट् (by which the word भोजन is formed). As we have already in _sutra_ (III. 3. 163) that after _sutras_ (III 1. 113) and forward, namely, in other _sutras_ than those treating of feminine affixes, the rule of (III. 1. 94) may be employed as an _Anitya_ or a non-universal rule.
