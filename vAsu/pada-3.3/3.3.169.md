sutra: अर्हे कृत्यतृचश्च
vRtti: अर्हे कर्त्तरिवाच्ये गम्यमाने वा धातोः कृत्यतृचः प्रत्यया भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes '_kritya_', and the affix '_trich_' are added to a root, when fitness as regards the agent is implied, as well as the affix '_lin_').

The force of च is to introduce the Potential (लिङ्) into this, from the last. Thus भवता खलु कन्या वोढव्या वाह्या or वहनीया, (_kritya_); or भवान् खलु कन्यया वोढा (_trich_); or भवान् खलु कन्यां वहेत् (_lin_) 'your honor is fit to marry the girl'.

Why specifically enjoin '_kritya_' and '_trich_' in the sense of fitness? They being enjoined universally, would a fortiori, be applied when fitness is to be denoted ? Because the लिङ् being specially enjoined to denote fitness, and being an _Apavada_, would have debarred _kritya_ and _trich_, which being universal affixes, would give way. Nor can we, to prevent this contingency, take shelter under rule (III. 1. 94) of 'non-uniform affixes', for we have seen that that rule is not universally valid.
