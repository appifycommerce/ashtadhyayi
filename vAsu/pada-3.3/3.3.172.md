sutra: शकि लिङ् च
vRtti: शक्नोत्यर्थोपाधिके धात्वर्थे लिङ्प्रत्ययो भवति चकारात् कृत्याश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: And the affix '_Lin_' as well as the '_kritya_' affixes come after a verb, when the sense is that of 'capability'.

---
The word 'capability' qualifies the root so that the sense of capability must be inherent in the root; Thus भवता खलु भारो वोढव्यः, वहनीयः, वाह्यः (_kritya_), or भवान् खलु भारं वहेत् 'you can carry the load'.

Though _kritya_-affixes would have come in this sense, even without any special rule, for they are general affixes, their special mention in this _sutra_ is to guard against their being superseded by लिङ्, for rule (III. 1. 94) is not universally valid.
