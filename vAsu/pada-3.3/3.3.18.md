sutra: भावे
vRtti: भावे वाच्ये धातोर्घञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ghan_' comes after a root when mere action is denoted.

Thus, पच् + घञ् = पाकः 'cooking' (VII. 2. 116) and (VII. 3. 52); त्यागः 'abandoning'; रागः 'colouring' (VI. 4. 27). An action expresses a general state; so that all roots denote 'action' when their meaning is to be expressed. And as the meaning of the root can be expressed by the root itself, therefore, the affixes घञ् &c. come after all verbal roots, when the sense of the root is denoted as having attained to the completed state. It is not necessary that the words so formed should be always of the masculine gender, singular number. They may take any other gender or number. As पक्तिः, पचनम्, पाकौ, पाकाः । These affixes form, in short, verbal nouns, or abstract nouns being names of action.
