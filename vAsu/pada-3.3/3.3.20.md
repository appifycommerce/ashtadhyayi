sutra: परिमाणाख्यायां सर्वेभ्यः
vRtti: परिमाणाख्यायां सर्वेभ्यो धातुभ्यो घञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ghan_' comes after all roots when the word so formed is the name of a measure.

Thus, नि + चि + घञ् = निचै + अ (VII. 2. 115) = निचाय (VI. 1. 78) 'a heap'; as एकस्तण्डुलनिचायः; द्वौ शूर्पनिष्पवौ । कॄ 'to scatter' + घञ् = कारः । द्वौ कारौ; त्रयः काराः ।

By using the word 'all' in the _sutra_, it is indicated that the affix अप् (III. 3. 57) is also superseded when this sense is to be indicated. Otherwise the affix अच् would only be prohibited by the _Paribhasha_:-"_Apavadas_ that precede the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the _apavada_-operations, supersede only those rules that stand nearest to them, not the subsequent rules". Thus अच् being taught in (III. 3. 56) would be superseded, but not so अप् taught in the subsequent aphorism (III. 3. 57).

Why do we say 'when they are the names of measures'? Observe निश्चयः 'ascertaining'.

The word आख्यः has been used in the aphorism in order to indicate that the words so formed are not Primitive words (रूढि). The numerals are also there included, and not only measures like _Prastha_, _Pala_ &c.

We have said above, that the force of the word सर्वेभ्यः in this _sutra_ is to indicate that the affix घञ् must be used after all verbs (not excluding even such verbs as require अच् or अप् by _sutras_ 56 and 57), when we want to express measure. This must be taken however, with certain limitations. The word सर्वेभ्यः is not after all so wide as at first sight it may appear. If we wish to form a word indicating measure, in the feminine gender, we cannot use घञ्; we must use the affix क्तिन् (III. 3. 94). In other words, the feminine affixes are not superseded by घञ् when it supersedes अच् and अप्. Thus in forming a feminine noun denoting measure, we have एकातिलोच्छित्तिः, द्वे प्रसूती &c.

Vart:- The affix घञ् comes after the causative verbs दारि and जारि, and there is _luk_ elision of the causative affix णिच्; when the word so formed is related to the verb as agent. Thus दारयन्ति भ्रातॄन् = दाराः 'a wife' (lit 'who divides brothers' a wife breaking up the brotherly love); जारयन्ति = जाराः 'a paramour'.
