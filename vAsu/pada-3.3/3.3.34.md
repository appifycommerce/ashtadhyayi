sutra: छंदो नाम्नि च
vRtti: विपूर्वात्स्तृणातेश्छन्दोनाम्नि घञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ghan_' comes after '_stri_' with the _upasarga_ '_vi_', when the word so formed is the name of a metre.

---
The word छन्द here means prosodial metre such as _Gayatri_ & c; and not the Vedas; otherwise the word नाम would not have been used. Thus वि + स्तृ + घञ् = वि + स्तृ + घञ् (VIII. 3. 94) = विष्टारः 'the name of a metre called _Vishtara_-_Pankti_'.

The whole word विष्टारपङ्क्ति is the name of a metre, and is not a word ending with the affix _ghan_; only a member of this word, i.e. the first part ends with _ghan_. The seventh case-affix in the word छन्दोनाम्नि has the force of location i.e. when the word so formed occurs in a portion of a name of a metre; it is not the full name, but it is in the name i.e. forms a portion of the name.
