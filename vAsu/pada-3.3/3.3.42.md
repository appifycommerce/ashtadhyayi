sutra: संघे चानौत्तराधर्य्ये
vRtti: संघे वाच्ये चिनोतेर्धातोर्घञ्प्रत्ययो भवति आदेश्च कः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ghan_' comes after the root '_chi_' (to gather) and '_k_' is the substitute of the initial '_ch_' in the sense of 'a multitude or assembly' (of living beings possessing some common characteristics), but not merely a confused crowd of men.

The word सङ्घ means a collection or assembly of living beings. It is of two sorts:- either by collection of persons possessing common qualifications, or a mere confused crowd of men. The collection denoting a confused crowd is here excepted and by _paryudasa_ negation the other is taken. Thus भिक्षुकनिकायः 'the assembly of beggars'; ब्राह्मणनिकायः 'the assembly of _Brahmanas_'; वैयाकरणनिकायाः 'the assembly of Grammarians'.

But सूकरनिचयः 'a herd of hogs'; because it is a mere collection. So also कृताकृतसमुच्चयः 'the collection of what is done and not done'; प्रमाणसमुच्चयः 'the collection of proofs'. Here there is no सङ्घ in either of the two senses, it not being a collection of living animals, the affix _ghan_ is not employed.
