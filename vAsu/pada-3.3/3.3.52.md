sutra: प्रे वणिजाम्
vRtti: प्र शब्द उपपदे ग्रहेर्धातोर्विभाषा घञ्प्रत्ययो भवति प्रत्ययान्तवाच्यश्चेद् वणिजां सम्बन्धी भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ghan_' is optionally employed after the verb '_grah_' in composition with '_pra_', when the word so formed relates to commerce.

Both the words _grah_ and _vibhasha_ are understood here. By 'relation to commerce' is meant here the string of the balance; and not commerce in general. That string by which a balance is held is called तुलाप्रग्रहः or तुलाप्रग्राहः, as तुलाप्रग्राहेण चरति or तुलाप्रग्रहेण चरति; and this may be said of any person whether he be a trader or not.

Why do we say 'when belonging to commerce'? Observe प्रग्रहो देवदत्तस्य 'the whip of _Devadatta_'.
