sutra: नित्यं पणः परिमाणे
vRtti: पण व्यवहारे स्तुतौ च, अस्माद्धातोर्नित्यमप्प्रत्ययो भवति परिमाणे गम्यमाने ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ap_' comes invariably after the verb '_pan_' (to barter), when the sense is that of measure.

---
The word नित्यं 'invariably' is used in the aphorism in order to stop the _anuvritti_ of the word optionally. Thus मूलकपणः 'a handful of radishes'; शाकपणः 'a handful of vegetable'. These words secondarily have come to mean 'a measure equal to a handful', irrespective of any thing.

When not meaning measure, we have पणः 'trade'.
