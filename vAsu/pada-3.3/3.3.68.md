sutra: प्रमदसम्मदौ हर्षे
vRtti: प्रमद सम्मद इत्येतौ निपात्येते हर्षेऽभिधेये ॥
vRtti_eng: The words '_pramada_' and '_sammada_' are irregularly formed, meaning joy'.

---
As कन्यानां प्रमदः 'the joy of girls'; कोकिलानां सम्मदः 'the rejoicing of cuckoos'.

Why do we say 'when meaning delight'? Observe प्रमादः 'carelessness'; सम्मादः 'frenzy'.

Instead of saying 'the verb _mad_ preceded by _pra_ and _sam_ takes the affix _ap_' which also would have given the above forms, the full forms have been used in the _sutra_ to indicate that these words are रूढि in this sense; for the sense of the root is not visible in these words.
