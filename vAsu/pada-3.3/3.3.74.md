The word आहावः is irregularly formed from ह्वे by the prefix आ, then _samprasarana_, and the _vriddhi_ of the vowel. Thus आ + ह्वे + अप् = आहु + अ = आहौ + अ = आहावः 'a trough near a well for watering cattle'. Otherwise आह्वायः 'calling'. Even in the word आहावः the sense of calling is understood. It is that place near a well, containing water, where cattle are called or invited to drink water.
