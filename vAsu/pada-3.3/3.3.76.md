sutra: हनश्च वधः
vRtti: हन्तेर्द्धातोरनुपसर्गे भावे अप्प्रत्ययो भवति, तत्संनियोगेन च वधादेशः, सचान्तोदात्तः ।
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ap_' comes after the root '_han_' when _upasarga_-less, in the sense of mere action, and '_vadha_' is the substitute of '_han_' before this affix.

Thus वध has _udatta_ accent on its final. The affix अप् which is _andatta_ generally (III. I. 4) thus becomes _udatta_.

As वधश्चोराणाम् 'the killing of thieves'; वधोदस्यूनाम् 'the killing of robbers'.

When action is not denoted, the affix घञ् applies; as घातः 'a blow'.

So also when an _upasarga_ is in composition with it; as प्रघातः, घातः ।

The word च in the aphorism does not connect हन् with the substitute वध, there being no co-ordination, it refers to the affixes under discussion. Thus we have the affix घञ् also; as घात: 'killing'.
