sutra: मन्त्रे वृषेषपचमनविदभूवीरा उदात्तः
vRtti: मन्त्रे विषये वृषादिभ्यो धातुभ्यः क्तिन्प्रत्ययो भवति उदात्तः ॥
vRtti_eng: In _Mantra_ literature, '_ktin_' acutely accented comes after the following roots, forming words in the feminine gender, denoting a mere action:-'_vrish_'(to rain), '_ish_'(to wish), '_pach_' (to cook), '_man_' (to think), '_vid_' (to know), '_bhu_'(to be), '_vi_' (to go, to consume) and '_ra_' (to give).

The construction of this _sutra_ is anomalous. Instead of the bases being put in the ablative case, they are put in the nominative case. Thus वृष्टिः 'raining'; इष्टिः 'wishing'; पक्तिः 'cooking'; मतिः 'thinking'; वित्तिः 'knowing'; भूतिः 'being'; वीतिः 'consuming'; रातिः 'giving'.
 
The affix क्तिन् has been generally ordained by _sutra_ 94 after all verbs. The present _sutra_ is made for the sake of regulating the accent in the case of these nouns. From इष् we have also an irregular noun इच्छा (III 3. 101), and another by the general rule 94 having acute accent on the first syllable, altogether 3 forms. See _Rig_ _Veda_ I. II6. 12; II 5. 6; 1.62. 3, 57. 2; IV. 24. 7; III. 39. I; I. 6. 5, 60. I; X. 95. 17 for these words.
