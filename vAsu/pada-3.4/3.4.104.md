sutra: किदाशिषि
vRtti: आशिषि यो लिङ् तस्य यासुडागमो भवति सचोदात्तः किद्वद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The augment '_yasut_' comes after that '_lin_' also which denotes benediction, and it is acutely accented, and the substitutes of this '_lin_' are as if they had an indicatory '_k_'.

The कित् of this _sutra_ refers to the personal affixes of the Benedictive mood and not to the augment यासुट्, for that would have been unnecessary, being already ङित् by the last rule. ङित् and कित् are equal in prohibiting _guna_ and _vriddhi_, but ङित् is distinguished from कित् in as much as ङित् causes the _guna_ of जागृ (VII. 3. 85), and also there is distinction between them with regard to the change of semi-vowel to vowel (VI. 1. 15) and (VI. 1. 16). Thus इष्यात्, इष्यास्ताम्, इष्यासुः, and जागर्यात्, जागर्यास्ताम् and जागर्यासुः । In the Potential, वच्यात् (no _samprasarana_); in the Benedictive, उच्यात् (vocalisation). So also जागृयात् in the Potential.
