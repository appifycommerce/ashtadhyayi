sutra: सिजभ्यस्तविदिभ्यश्च
vRtti: सिचः परस्य अभ्यस्त संज्ञकेभ्यो वेत्तेश्चोत्तरस्य जुसादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: (In those tenses which are marked with an indicatory '_n_') '_jus_' is the substitute of '_jhi_', when it comes after an Aorist in '_sich_', or the Imperfect of a reduplicated verb, or the root '_vid_' (to know).

This applies to tenses having ङ् other than that of लिङ्, namely, the लङ् and लुङ् ।

सिच् is employed in forming the first Aorist. The reduplicated verbs, as well as the verb विद्, form their third person plural in जुस्, in the tenses other than लिङ्, and those that take सिच् । The word ङितः of _sutra_ (III. 4. 99), is understood here also; and therefore this rule is restricted to the Imperfect (लङ्) of the reduplicated verb. Thus of सिच्, we have अकार्षुः, अहार्षः । Similarly, after the Imperfect of the reduplicated verbs, we have अविभयुः, अजिहयुः, अजागरुः । In the case of विद्, we have अविदुः ।
