sutra: आतः
vRtti: सिच आकारान्ताच्च परस्य झेर्जुसादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: (When '_sich_' is elided), '_jus_' is the substitute of '_jhi_', after an Aorist stem which ends in long '_a_'.

---
The सिच् is elided by rule (2.4.77). Thus अदुः, अधुः, अस्थुः । In other words, in those cases, where सिच् is elided by rules (2.4.77), (2.4.78) and (2.4.79), only जुस् is the substitute of झि where the verbs end in long आ । In other words, this _sutra_ restricts the scope of the last _sutra_, by which after every सिच्, जुस् was to replace झि ।

The Present _sutra_ says that after verbs in which सिच् has been elided, जुस् does not replace झि in the case of any other verb than that which ends in long आ; it is thus a _niyama_ rule.

Thus, by rule (2.4.77), सिच् is elided after the verb भू, but as भू does not end in long आ, its 3rd person plural Aorist will not be in जुस् । Thus, अनुभवन् । Here, by the last rule, and on the maxim that 'though सिच् is elided, yet its force remains (1.1.62)', जुस् would have replaced झि; but the present _sutra_ prohibits that. But where the सिच् is not elided, there, of course, जुस् does come. Thus अकार्षुः, अहार्षुः ।
