sutra: लिट् च
vRtti: लिडादेशस्तिङार्द्धधातुकसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The personal endings of the Perfect are also called '_ardhadhatuka_'.

This debars them from being called _sarvadhatuka_ and, being _ardhadhatuka_, some of them take the augment इट्; as पेचिथ, शेकिथ । Moreover by their being _ardhadhatuka_ they do not admit of the _Vikaranas_ शप् &c.

So from ग्लै (ग्ला, VI. 1. 45) we have जग्ले; here the आ is elided by (VI. 4. 64), the affix being treated as _ardhadhatuka_; similarly मम्ले from म्लै ।
