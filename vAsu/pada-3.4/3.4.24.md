sutra: विभाषाग्रेप्रथमपूर्वेषु
vRtti: अग्रे प्रथम पूर्व इत्येतेषूपपदेषु समानकर्तृकयोः पूर्वकाले धातोः क्त्वाणमुलौ प्रत्ययौ विभाषा भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes '_ktva_' and '_namul_' come optionally after that verb which denotes the prior action, when both verbs have the same agent, provided that the following words are in composition:- '_agre_', '_prathama_' and '_purva_'.

This is an _Aprapta_-_vibhasha_. The word 're-iteration' is not understood here. Thus अग्रे, प्रथमं, पूर्वं वा भोजं भुक्त्वा व्रजति  'having first eaten he goes'.

By using the word 'optionally' it is indicated, that the regular Tenses, such as the Present &c, may be employed also. Thus अग्रे भुङ्क्ते ततः व्रजति 'he eats first and then goes'.

Q-- The affixes of _Lat_ (Present tense) &c. would have been applied by the rule of वाऽसरूप (III. 1. 94); why then use the word 'optionally'?
Ans.-- The very use of the word 'optionally' in this _sutra_ indicates the existence of this _Paribhasha_ :- "The rule (III. I. 94) has no concern with the affixes _ktva_ and _namul_, when both these affixes are enjoined at one and the same time by a single rule."

Therefore, we cannot apply (III. 1. 94) and use the affixes _Lat_ &c, when 're-iteration' is meant That is the exclusive province of क्त्वा and णमुल् ।

Why is not here the _Upapada_ compounding by rule (II. 2. 20)? For an answer to this, see the commentary on (II. 2. 20). Had only णमुल् been enjoined by this _sutra_, and not क्त्वा also, then we could have formed the उपपद समास, for such is the force of the word एव in that _sutra_.
