sutra: कर्मण्याक्रोशे कृञः खमुञ्
vRtti: कर्मण्युपपदे कृञो धातोः खमुञ् प्रत्ययो भवति आक्रोशे गम्यमाने ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_khamun_' is added to the verb '_kri_' (to make), when a word in the accusative case is in construction with it, if the sense intended implies 'abuse'.

Of the affix  खमुञ्, the efficient portion is अम्; the indicatory ख introduces the augment मुम् (VI. 3. 67). Thus चोरं कारमाक्रोशति 'he reviles him as thief, i. e. he calls out in abuse 'thou art a thief., thou art a robber, &c.' The person is not really made a thief, but making him a thief is to express one's indignation.
