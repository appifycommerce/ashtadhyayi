sutra: कर्मणि दृशिविदोः साकल्ये
vRtti: कर्मण्युपपदे साकल्यविशिष्टेऽर्थे दृशिविदोर्द्धात्वोर्णमुल् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When the object is compounded with it, the verb '_dris_' (to see), or '_vid_' (to know), takes the affix '_namul_', to denote the total number of such objects.

Thus कन्यादर्शं वरयति 'he woos every girl that he sees i.e. all the girls seen'. ब्राह्मणवेदं भोजयति 'he feeds as many _Brahmanas_ as he knows, i.e. all'.

Why do we say 'when denoting the total number of such objects'? Observe ब्राह्मणं दृष्ट्वा भोजयति 'having seen the _Brahmana_ he feeds him'.
