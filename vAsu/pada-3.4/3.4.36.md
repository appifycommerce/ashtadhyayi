sutra: समूलाकृतजीवेषु हन्कृञ्ग्रहः
vRtti: समूल अकृत जीव इत्येतेषु शब्देषु कर्मसूपपदेषु यथासंख्यं हन् कृञ् ग्रह् इत्येतेभ्यो धातुभ्यो णमुल् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_namul_' comes after the verbs '_han_' (to kill), '_kri_' (to make) and '_grah_' (to seize), when the words '_samula_', '_akrita_' and '_jiva_' in the accusative case are respectively compounded with them.

Thus समूलघातं हन्ति (VIII. 3. 32) and (VIII. 3. 54) 'he destroys so as to tear up by the roots i.e. he totally extirpates'; अकृतकारं करोति 'he does a thing which was not done before'; तं जीवग्राहं गृह्णाति 'captures him so as to preserve his life, i. e. captures him alive'. Here also appropriate verbs from the same roots are used to govern the gerund.
