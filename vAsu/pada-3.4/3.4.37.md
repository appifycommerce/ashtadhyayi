Thus पाणिघातं वेदिं हन्ति (VII. 3. 32) and (VII. 3. 54) = पाणिना वेदिं हन्ति 'the strikes the _Vedi_ with the hand'; पादघातं भूमिं हन्ति 'he strikes the ground with the foot'. Reading this _sutra_ along with (III. 4. 48), we find that हन् here does not mean 'to kill', and the further difference between this aphorism and that is, that in the case of this _sutra_ a cognate verb from the same root must be used, as the gerund; not so in _sutra_ (III. 4. 48); or this _sutra_ may be for the sake of forming Invariable compounds with the _upapadas_, such as पादघातं ।

According to _Patanjali_, this affix comes after हन् under this aphorism, even when हन् means 'to injure'; thus counteracting rule (III. 4. 48), by anticipation, and in opposition to the general principle of interpretation enunciated in rule (I. 4. 2). Thus असिघातं हन्ति 'he kills with the sword'; शरघातं हन्ति 'he kills with arrows'.

Rule (III. 4. 46) applies here also, and an appropriate verb from the same root is employed to govern the gerund.
