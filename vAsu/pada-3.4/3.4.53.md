Thus यष्टिग्राहम् (or यष्टिं ग्राहम्) युध्यन्ते 'they fight, having hastily taken up sticks'. That is, they are in such a haste to fight, that they do not tarry to take up the proper weapons, offensive and defensive, but engage in fight with anything that is at hand, such as sticks, stones &c. Similarly लोष्ट्रग्राहम् or लोष्ट्रं ग्राहम् ।
