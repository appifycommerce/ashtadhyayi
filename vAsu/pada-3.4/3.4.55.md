sutra: परिक्लिश्यमाने च
vRtti: परिक्लिश्यमाने च स्वाङ्गवाचिनि द्वितीयान्त उपपदे धातोर्णमुल् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_namul_' comes after a root, when a word in the Accusative case denoting a limb of one's own body, which is completely afflicted by the action, is in composition.

The word परिक्लिश्यमान means 'completely hurt or affected'. Thus उरः प्रतिपेषं or उरःपेषं युध्यन्ते = कृत्स्नमुरः पीडयन्तः 'they fight so as to afflict their whole bosom'. So also शिरःपेषं or शिरःप्रतिपेषं ।

The difference between this and the last _sutra_ consists in this, that this _sutra_ applies even to vital organs, such as 'breast', 'head' &c; while the last aphorism applies 'non-vital organs' only.
