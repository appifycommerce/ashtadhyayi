sutra: विशिपतिपदिस्कन्दां व्याप्यमानासेव्यमानयोः
vRtti: द्वितीयान्त उपपदे विश्यादिभ्यो धातुभ्यो णमुल् प्रत्ययो भवति व्याप्यमाने आसेव्यमाने चार्थे गम्यमाने ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_namul_' comes after the verbs '_vis_' (to enter), '_pat_' (to fall), '_pad_' (to go) and '_skand_' (to leap), when a word in the Accusative case is in composition, and when the sense denoted is that of complete pervasion and total absorption.

The word व्याप्ति (or व्याप्यमान) means the full and complete pervasion of the substances with the actions (denoted by the verbs विश्, &c). The word आसेवा means 'assiduous performance of any action, or absorption into it'. In other words, 'frequency' of an action is आसेवा । The word व्याप्ति therefore refers to the noun (in the accusative case) and आसेवा to the verb (such as _vis_ &c). These two words have the same significance here as the words नित्य and वीप्सा in _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 4.) and by the application of that rule, both the noun and the verb require to be repeated. That rule, however, will not apply here, when there is compounding by (II. 2. 21). But when there is no compounding, (for rule (II. 2. 21.) makes composition only optional) then there is repetition of the noun if व्याप्ति 'all' is meant; and of the verb, if आसेवा 'frequency or assiduous performance' is meant. Thus गेहानुप्रवेशमास्ते, (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रवेशमास्ते or गेहमनुप्रवेशमनुप्रवेशमास्ते) 'having entered the house, he sits down', meaning either, 'having entered every house in succession, he sits down', or 'having repeatedly entered the house, he sits down'.

Similarly with the root पत्, we may have three examples as in the last, and so also with the roots पद् and स्कन्द् । Thus गेहानुप्रपातमास्ते (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रपातमास्ते or गेहमनुप्रपातमनुप्रपातमास्ते); गेहानुप्रपादमास्ते (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रपादं or गेहमनुप्रपादमनुप्रपादम्); गेहावस्कन्दमास्ते (or गेहगेहमवस्कन्दं or गेहमवस्कन्दमवस्कन्दम्) ।

Why do we say 'when the sense is that of all or frequency'? Observe, गेहमनुप्रविश्य भुङ्क्ते 'having entered the house, he eats'.

Q.- By _sutra_ (III. 4. 22), _namul_ would have been valid, when _abhikshna_ was meant; and _abhikshna_ and _aseva_ mean the same thing i. e, 'frequency'. Why then ordain _namul_ again, by the present _sutra_, in the sense of _aseva_ ? If you say, "we repeat it, in order to prevent the coming of the affix क्त्वा", that is not so. For क्त्वा would come by वाऽसरूप rule; (see (III. 1. 94) and (III. 4. 47)).

A.- The repetition is for the sake of _Upapada_-_samasa_ with a word in the accusative case. Under rule 22, there was no _upapada_, while in the present case there is an _upapada_.

Professor Bohtlingk translates this _sutra_ thus:- "विश्, पत्, पद्, and स्कन्द् in composition with an accusative, form the absolutive gerund in अम् (_namul_), when one wishes to express that every object of that name is completely affected by the action, or that the action is constantly repeated in that object."
