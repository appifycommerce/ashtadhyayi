sutra: शकधृषज्ञाग्लाघटरभलभक्रमसहार्हास्त्यर्थेषु तुमुन्
vRtti: शकादिषूपपदेषु अस्त्यर्थेषु वा धातुमात्रात् तुमुन्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_tumun_' is added to every verb, when another verb having the sense of '_sak_' (to be able), '_dhrish_' (to make bold), '_jna_' (to know), '_glai_' (to be wearied), '_ghat_' (to strive), '_rabh_' (to begin), '_labh_' (to get), '_kram_' (to set about), '_sah_' (to bear), '_arh_' (to be pleased or to condescend), and '_as_' (to be), is in construction.

The use of the Infinitive in तुमुन् formed by this rule, differs from that given in _sutra_ (III. 3. 10). In that _sutra_ the Infinitive had the force of 'purpose' and here there is no such force. Moreover in this case there is an _upapada_ in construction, though that _upapada_ is a verb; in rule (III. 3. 10), there was no such _upapada_.

Thus शक्नोमि भोक्तुम् 'I am able to eat'. Similarly जानाति—ग्लायति—घटते—आरभते—लभते—प्रक्रमते—सहते—अर्हति—अस्ति—भवति—or विद्यते भोक्तुम् 'he knows', he is wearied, he strives, he begins, he gets, he proceeds, he bears, he condescends or he is, to eat'.

This _sutra_ presents a knotty point. _Bhattoji_ _Dikshita_ says अर्थग्रहणमस्तिनैव सम्बध्यते अनन्तरत्वात् i.e. the _sutra_ gives roots from शक् to अर्ह and roots having the same sense as अस् 'to be'. But this is hardly consistent with the almost overwhelming evidence of usage. According to _Dikshita_'s interpretation, पारय 'to be able' cannot be used with the Infinitive, but न पारयामि निवेदयितुम् (S. 4), पारयिष्यस्यत्रभवत्यअपरान्दधुम् (M. 3.) are instances from a standard author; similarly विद् 'to know' cannot be used with the Infinitive; but न च वेद सम्यग् द्रष्टुम् न सा (R. VI. 30) is as good an instance. We must, therefore, suppose that the _sutra_ indicates the existence of an interpretation connecting अर्थ with all the preceding roots; otherwise we shall have to condemn as wrong, all such constructions as those given above. Taking this view I have interpreted the _sutra_, connecting अर्थ with all the above roots.- _Apte_'s Composition.
