sutra: कर्तरि कृत्
vRtti: कृत्संज्ञकाः प्रत्ययाः कर्तरि कारके भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes called '_krit_' are used in the sense of an agent.

---
The words formed by _krit_ affixes have the sense of agency; when no other special sense has been assigned to them by any rule, then this rule will apply, and fix the force of the affix. This rule will not, therefore, apply to _krit_ affixes like ख्युन् (III. 2. 5) and (III. 2. 6) to which a special sense has been assigned, but affixes like ण्वुल् and तृच् &c, (III. 1. 133). Thus कारकः means a 'doer'; कर्त्ता 'an agent'; नन्दनः 'one who causes happiness'; ग्राही 'who seizes'; पचः 'who cooks'.
