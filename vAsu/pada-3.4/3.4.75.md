sutra: ताभ्यामन्यत्रोणादयः
vRtti: उणादयः शब्दास्ताभ्यामपादानसंप्रदानाभ्यामन्यत्र कारके भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The words formed by '_Unadi_' affixes denote other ideas than these two, i. e., recepient and ablation.

The _Unadi_ affixes being a subdivision of _krit_ affixes, would have, by rule (III. 4. 67), denoted the agent. By the present _sutra_ they are made to denote the object, the instrument and the location also. The word ताभ्यां has been used in the _sutra_ in order to include the word _sampradana_ also. For, had the _sutra_ been अन्यत्रोणादयः, only the _Apadana_ _karaka_ would have been excluded, as being the nearest; but not so the _Sampradana_ _karaka_. Thus कृषितोऽसौ = कृषिः (_Un_. IV. 120) 'agriculture i.e. what is ploughed' (object); तन्यत इति = तन्तुः (_Un_. 1. 69) 'a thread i.e. what is drawn out'; वृत्तमिति वर्त्म (_Un_. IV. 145) 'a way i.e. what is established'; चरितं = चर्म (_Un_. IV. 145) 'skin' (in which they live).
