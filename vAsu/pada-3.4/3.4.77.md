This _sutra_ consists of one word लस्य meaning 'of ल'. It is an _adhikara_ _sutra_. The word लस्य is the genitive singular of ल, the अ in ल being for the sake of pronunciation. The ल means the ten affixes: लट् present, लिट् perfect, लुट् first future, लृट् second future, लोट् imperative लेट् Vedic subjunctive, लङ् imperfect, लिङ् potential and benedictive, लुङ् aorist, लृङ् conditional. Six of these tenses have indicatory ट्, and four have indicatory ङ् । 

Professor Bohtlingk translates this _sutra_ thus:- In the following _sutras_, the word लस्य should be supplied to complete the sense, i.e. the phrase 'in the place of all those endings which are known as the Personal endings of various tenses and moods, and are known in their totality as ल' ।
