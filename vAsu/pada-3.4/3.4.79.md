sutra: टित आत्मनेपदानां टेरे
vRtti: टितो लकारस्य स्थाने यान्यात्मनेपदानि तेषां टेरेकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The substitute '_e'_ replaces the last vowel, with the consonant that follows it, of the '_Atmanepada_' substitutes of that '_la_' which has an indicatory '_t_'.

---
The ल or the tense-affixes that have an indicatory ट् are six:- लट्, लिट्, लुट्, लृट्, लोट्, लेट् । In these tenses the final portion called टि of the _Atmanepada_ affixes is changed into ए । Thus त becomes ते, आताम् becomes आते, झ becomes झे &c, as shown in the foregoing table.

The affixes शानच्, and कानच् are also _Atmanepada_ affixes. Why are not their finals changed into ए as in पचमानः, यजमानः? Because the word आत्मनेपदानां in the _sutra_ refers by context to the _Atmanepada_ affixes included in the _Pratyahara_ तिङ् ।
