sutra: एरुः
vRtti: लोडादेशानामिकारस्य उकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the Imperative, '_u_' is substituted for '_i_'.

Thus ति becomes तु, अन्ति becomes अन्तु, as have already been given in the above table.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of affixes हि and नि of लोट् । In the case of these two affixes, the इ is not changed into उ, either because they have been so taught in the _sutras_, or because the वा of _sutra_ (III. 4. 83) is understood here also and makes this rule an optional rule of limited scope as in the last _sutra_ (व्यवस्थित विभाषा). Thus पचतु, पचन्तु ।

In fact, this _sutra_ is confined to ति and झि only and does not apply to सि to which the next _sutra_ applies.
