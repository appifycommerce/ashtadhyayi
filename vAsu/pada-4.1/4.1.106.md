sutra: मधुबभ्रोर्ब्राह्मणकौशिकयोः
vRtti: मधुशब्दाद्बभ्रु शब्दाच्च गोत्रापत्ये यञ् प्रत्ययो भवति यथासंख्यं ब्राह्मणे कौशिके वाच्ये ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix यञ् comes, in the sense of a _Gotra_ descendant, after the words मधु and बभ्रु when the words so formed mean '_Brahmana_' and 'a _Kausika_' respectively.

Thus माधव्यः = ब्राह्मणः '_Brahmana_.' Otherwise माधवः "son of _Madhu_." बाभ्रव्यः = कौशिकः Otherwise बाभ्रवः ॥

The word बभ्रु belongs to the _Gargadi_ class, so it would have taken _yan_ by the last _sutra_ also. The present _sutra_ declares a restriction, viz. बभ्रु takes यञ् only then when कौशिक is denoted. Its being read in the _Gargadi_ class serves another purpose : as it belongs to the sub-class लोहितादि, the rule (IV. 1. 18) becomes applicable to it; so that its feminine is formed by ष्फ. Thus बाभ्रव्यायणी ॥ In fact, it would have been better, if in the body of the _Ganapatha_, instead of writing बभ्रु alone, there was बभ्रु कौशिके ॥ It would have saved the repetition of it in the present _sutra_.
