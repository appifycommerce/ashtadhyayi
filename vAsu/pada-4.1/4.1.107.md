sutra: कपिबोधादाङ्गिरसे
vRtti: कपिबोधशब्दाभ्यामाङ्गिरसेऽपत्यविशेषे गोत्रे यञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix 'यञ्' comes in the sense of a _Gotra_ descendant, after the words कपि and बोध, when the special descendants of the family of _Angiras_ are meant.

Thus कपि + यञ् = काप्यः 'the grand-son or a still lower descendant of '_Kapi_' of the family of _Angiras_.' So also बौध्यः ॥

Why do we say of the family of _Angiras_ ? Observe कापेयः (IV. I. 122) "the _gotra_-descendant of _Kapi_" so also बौधिः formed by इञ् because it is a Non-_Rishi_ word or because it belongs to _Bahvadi_ (IV. 1. 96) class.

The word कपि occurs in _Gargadi_ class. The present _sutra_ declares a restriction i. e. the '_yan_' is to be applied only when _Angirasa_ descendant is meant. It is included in the _Gargadi_ class also for the purpose of applying (IV. I. 18). Thus काप्यायनी "grand-daughter or a still lower descendant of _Kapi_."
