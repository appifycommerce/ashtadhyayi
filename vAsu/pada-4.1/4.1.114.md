sutra: ऋष्यन्धकवृष्णिकुरुभ्यश्च
vRtti: ऋषयः प्रसिद्धा वसिष्ठादयः । अन्धका वृष्णयः कुरव इति वंशाख्या । ऋष्यादिकुर्वन्तेभ्यः प्रातिपदिकेभ्यो ऽपत्ये ऽणप्रत्ययो भवती, ञोऽपवादः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् comes, in the sense of a descendant, after a Nominal-stem denoting the name of a _Rishi_, or the name of a person of the family of _Andhaka_, _Vrishni_, and _Kuru_.
---
This debars the affix इञ् ॥ The _Rishis_ are like _Vasishtha_, _Visvamitra_ &c. Thus वासिष्ठः, वैश्वामित्रः ॥ So also श्वाफल्कः, रान्धसः being persons belonging to the family of _Andhaka_; and वासुदेवः, आनुरुद्धः being persons belonging to the family of _Vrishni_, and नकुलः, साहदेवः being persons belonging to the family of _Kuru_.

The word अत्रि is the name of a _Rishi_, in forming its Patronymic, the present _sutra_ enjoins अण्; but (IV. I. 122) enjoins ढक्; thus there being a conflict, we apply the maxim of interpretation contained in (1. 4. 2). So that the Patronymic or अत्रि will be formed not by अण् but by ढक् ॥ Thus आत्रेयः ॥ Similarly उग्रसेन a person of _Andhaka_ family, forms its patronymic औग्रसेन्यः (IV. 1. 152) by ण्य; and not by अण्, so also वैष्वकसेन्य 'son of _Vaishvaksena_' a person of _Vrishni_, family; so also भैमसेन्यः 'son of _Bhimasena_' a person of _Kuru_ family.

Note.- The words or _sabdas_ are eternal; how is it that rules applying to them should be made dependant upon their occurring in particular families or not, when families themselves are non-eternal? In other word, how a rule affecting a permanent object is conditioned by an impermanent adjunct? To this, some reply that _Panini_ has by mere coincidence (and not as cause and effect) classified certain definite number of words as belonging to certain families, and then the rule made applicable to them. Moreover a permanent object is sometimes designated by an impermanent object : as the permanent time is designated by the name of _Saka_. Others say that the families of _Andhaka_ &c., are also permanent, and the words '_Nakula_' '_Sahadeva_' &c., found therein are, of course, permanent.
