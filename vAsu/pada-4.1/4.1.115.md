sutra: मातुरुत्संख्यासंभद्रपूर्वायाः
vRtti: मातृशब्दात्संख्यापूर्वात्संपूर्वाद्भद्रपूर्वाश्चापत्ये ऽण् प्रत्ययो भवति, उकारश्चान्तादेशः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् comes in the sense of a descendant, after the word _matri_ when it is preceded by a Numeral, or by the words सम् or भद्र; and the letter उ is substituted for the final ऋ of _matri_.

Thus from द्विमातृ we have द्वैमातुरः "son of two mothers i.e. son of one and adopted by another." द्विमातृ + अण् = द्वैमात् + उ + अ = द्वैमात् + उ + र् + अ (I. I. 51.) Similarly षाण्मातुरः, सांमातुरः, and भाद्रमातुरः ॥

This _sutra_ is made in order to teach the substitution of short उ for ऋ of मातृ; for the word मातृ would have taken the affix अण् by the general rule (IV. 1. 83). The _sutra_ contains the word पूर्वायाः in the feminine gender, showing by implication that the rule applies where the word मातृ denotes female. Thus संमिमीते = संमातृ 'he who measures together'. Its patronymic will be सांमात्रः 'son of a fellow-measurer'; because here the word मातृ does not mean 'mother', but a 'measure'. Nor the word धान्यमातृ 'barley measurer' will be affected by this rule. Why do we say "when preceded by a Numeral &c." Observe सौमात्रः 'son of _Sumatri_'. The word वैमात्रेयः is formed by (IV. 1. 123) as belonging to _Subhradi_ class.
