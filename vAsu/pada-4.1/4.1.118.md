sutra: पीलाया वा
vRtti: पीलाया अपत्ये वाण् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् comes optionally after the word पीला in denoting a descendant.

The word पीला being the name of a female would have taken अण् by (IV. 1. 113); but this अण् would have been prohibited by (IV. 1. 121) as it is a dissyllabic feminine word. Hence the necessity of the present _sutra_. Thus पैलः or पैलेयः 'son of _Pila_.'
