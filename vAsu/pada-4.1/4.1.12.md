sutra: अनो बहुव्रीहेः
vRtti: अन्नन्ताद् बहुव्रीहेः स्त्रियाम् ङीप् प्रत्ययो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ङीप् is not employed to denote the feminine, after a _Bahuvrihi_ compound ending in अन् ।

---
This refers to those _Bahuvrihi_ compounds in which the penultimate is not elided. Of the _Bahuvrihi_ compounds which lose their penultimate letter, it is optional to employ this affix or not; as it will be taught in (4.1.28). Thus सुपर्वन् 'possessed of beautiful joints' is both masculine and feminine. As सुपर्वा, सुपर्वाणौ, सुपर्वाणः; so also सुशर्मा, सुशर्माणौ and सुशर्माणः ॥ In these cases the penultimate अ of वन् or मन् is not elided. See (6.4.137).

Why do we say "after _Bahuvrihi_ compounds" ? Because after any other compouds, this rule will not apply. As अतिराजन् is an _Avyayibhava_ compound, its feminine will be अतिराजी ॥
