sutra: टिड्ढाणञ्द्वयसज्दघ्नज्मात्रच्तयप् ठक् ठञ्कञ्क्वरपः
vRtti: टिदादिभ्यः प्रातिपदिकेभ्यः स्त्रियां ङीप् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ङीप् is added, in the feminine, after the Nominal-stems ending in short अ, if the affix with which it ends has an indicatory ट, or if the affix be ढ, or अण्, or आञ् or द्वयसच् , or दघ्नच्, or मात्रच्, or तयप्, or ठक्, or ठञ् or कञ् or क्वरप् ॥

The word अतः 'ending in short अ' is understood here by _anuvritti_ from (IV. 1. 4); and qualifies the affixes above-mentioned, wherever necessary. This debars the affix टाप् of (IV. 1. 4). We shall give example of each seriatim (1) Thus, m., कुरुचर f., कुरुचरी m., मद्रचर f, मद्रचरी (चर + ई = चर् + ई; the final अ  is elided by (VI. 4. 148).) The word _kuru_-_chara_ is formed by ट (III. 2. 16). of which ट् is indicatory.

Q. It might be objected, "why is not the affix ङीप् added after the words पचमान, formed by the affix शानच् (III. 2. 124) in as much as this affix is a substitute of लट्; and because लट् has an indicatory ट्, therefore, its substitute will also be supposed to have an indicatory ट् (I. 1. 57)."

A. To this we reply, 'the affix लट् is not टित् as it has two indicatory letters, ल् and ट्'.

Q. If that be so, affixes like ल्युट् should also be called no टित् affixes, as they have also two indicatory letters.

A. To this we reply, that if ल्युट् be not regarded टित्, then the indicatory ट् of ल्युट् finds no scope any where: as the indicatory ट् of लट् has its scope in _sutra_ (III. 4. 79). Therefore, the feminine of पचमान will be पचमाना ॥ Similarly, the indicatory ट् of augments will not cause the application of the affix ङीप्; thus पठिता विद्या ॥ Here the feminine of पठिता is formed by आ and not इ. This is indicated by _sutra_ (IV. 3. 23), which says "augment तुट् is added to the affixes ट्यु and ट्युल्". If the ट् of तुट् could have made the affix टित् for the purposes of this present _sutra_; the _anubandha_ ट् had been unnecessarily added to the affixes यु and युल् in the above.

(2) Of words ending in ढ we have, m, सौपर्णेय f. सौपर्णेयी so also f. वैनतेयी. The ढ stands for the affix ढक्; and it is replaced by एय् (VII. 1. 2) . Thus सुपर्णा + ढक् (IV. 1. 120)= सुपर्णा + एय = सौपर्णेय (VII. 2. 118). There is no affix which is merely ढ without any indicatory letters; and denoting the feminine; the only affix, as said above, is ढक् ॥ Therefore, the following maxim does not apply here :- "When a term void of _anubandhas_ (indicatory letters) is imployed in grammar, it does not denote that which has an _anubandha_ attached to it", and we cannot say that the ड of this _sutra_ refers to the _anubandha_-less ढ of (V. 3. 102) which is always Neuter.

(3) Of words in अण्, we have already said that the affix अण् here refers to both the _Krit_ and the _Taddhita_ affix '_an_'. Thus with the _krit_ affix '_an_' we have कुम्भकार and नगरकार (III. 2. 1), the feminine of which is कुम्भकारी and नगरकारी ॥ With the _Taddhita_ affix '_an_' we have औपगव (IV. 1. 92), the feminine of which is औपगवी ॥ Sometimes words formed by the addition of the affix ण are operated upon as if they were formed by अण् ॥ Thus चौरी, तापसी are the feminine of चौर and तापस (IV. 4. 62), sometimes words formed by ण are not so treated, as दाण्डा, मौष्टा (IV. 2. 57).

(4) Words formed by अञ् as औत्स f. औत्सी, औदपान, f. औदपानी, (IV. 1. 86). Though by (IV. 1. 73) the affix ङीन् would have come after the words ending in अञ्, the re-employment of this affix in the present _sutra_ is for the purpose of preventing the application of the affix ङीष् which would have presented itself by (IV. 1. 63); that is even when '_jati_' is indicated, '_nish_' is not to be employed here.

(5) The three affixes द्वयसच्, दघ्नच् and मात्रच् are added by (V. 2. 37); as, ऊरुद्वयसी, ऊरुदघ्नी, ऊरुमात्री 'reaching to the thigh'. Similarly जानुद्वयसी, जानुदघ्नी, जानुमात्री ।

(6) So also with words formed by तयप् (V. 2. 42). As पञ्चतयी 'of which the parts are five' so also दशतयी ॥

(7) So also with words ending in ठञ् (IV. 4. 1) as, आक्षिकी 'a female dicer', शालाकिकी. The ठ is replaced by इक (VII. 3. 50).

(8) Similarly with words ending in ठञ् (V. 1. 18): as, लावणिकी 'elegant'. The affixes ठक् and ठञ् are separately enumerated in this _sutra_, in order to exclude the affix ठन् &c. For had the word ठ merely been used, then it would have meant all the three affixes ठक्, ठन् and ठञ्, which is not desired.

(9) Similarly with words ending in कञ् (III. 2. 60) as, यादृशी, तादृशी ॥

(10) So also with words ending in क्वरप् (III. 2. 163) as इत्वरी 'swift', नश्वरी ॥

Vart:- In addition to the foregoing, there should have been the enumeration of the affixes नञ् and स्नञ् (IV. 1. 87) and ईकक् (IV. 4. 59) and ख्युन् (III. 2. 56) and of the words तरुण and तलुन 'a youth'. Thus स्त्रैणी 'a female', पौंस्नी 'a male', शाक्तीकी 'a female spear bearer', आढ्यंकरणी 'enriching'; तरुणी or तलुनी 'a young woman'.
