sutra: जीवति तु वंश्ये युवा
vRtti: अभिजनप्रबन्धो वंशः । तत्रभवो वंश्यः पित्रादि, स्तस्मिन् जीवति सति पौत्रप्रभृत्यपत्यं युवसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "But when one in a line of descent beginning with a father (and reckoning upwards) is alive, the descendant of a grandson or still lower descendant is called _Yuvan_ only."

The word वंश means an uninterrupted series of family descent-or 'a line'. One who occurs in such a line, like father &c, is called वंश्य ॥ When such a _vansya_ is alive, then the descendant of a grandson &c is called _Yuvan_. The phrase पौत्रप्रभृतपत्य in the _sutra_ should be construed as पौत्रप्रभृतेर् यद् अपत्यम्. 'He who is the descendant of a grandson &c' In the last _sutra_, however, this phrase पौत्रप्रभृत्यपत्यं was properly construed by putting the word पौत्रप्रभृति in the case of apposition with अपत्यम् meaning "a descendant being a grandson &c." Thus the word _Yuvan_ will be applied to a person who is at least fourth in the order of descent, from the propositus with reference to whom the derivative is made. Thus गर्गः being the head, we have गर्गः

-	अपत्यम् - गार्गिः (son or _putra_)
-	अपत्यम् - गार्ग्यः (_Gotra_)
-	अपत्यम् - गार्ग्यायणः (_Yuvan_)

(if _Garga_ or _Gargi_ &c be alive). The force of the word तु, in the _sutra_ is that it will be called _Yuvan_ only, and not _Gotra_ as well.
