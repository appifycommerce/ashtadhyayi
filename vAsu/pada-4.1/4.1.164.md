sutra: भ्रातरि च ज्यायसि
vRtti: भ्रातरि ज्यायसि जीवति कनीयान् युवसंज्ञो भवति पौत्त्त्रप्रभृतेरपत्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: When an elder brother is alive, the younger brother gets the title of _Yuvan_, being the descendant of a grandson &c.

Even when a वंश्य like father &c is not alive (and a brother is not _vansya_), the younger brother gets the designation of _yuvan_, when the elder brother is alive; thus:

गर्गः (dead) -> गार्गिः (dead) -> गार्ग्यः (dead) ->  गार्ग्यः, गार्ग्यायणः

The word वंश्यः is confined to ancestors like father &c, so a brother can never be a _vansya_, because he is not the source from which the other brother arises. This _sutra_ applies to cases when _Vansya_ is not meant. Thus _Gargyayna_ is the name of the younger brother with reference to the elder brother, _Gargya_; similarly _Vatsyayana_, _Dakhsayana_, and _Plakshayana_.
