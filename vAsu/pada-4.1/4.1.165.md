sutra: वान्यस्मिन् सपिण्डे स्थविरतरे जीवति
vRtti: भ्रातुरन्यस्मिन्सपिण्डे स्थविरतरे जीवति पौत्त्रप्रभृतेरपत्यं जीवदेव युवसंज्ञं वा भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The living descendant of a grandson &c is called optionally a _Yuvan_, when a more superior _sapinda_ other than a brother is alive."

The _sapinda_ relationship extends up to seven degrees. The word स्थविर means 'superior', and स्थविरतर is comparative and means 'more superior', that is to say, superior both by degree of descent and by age. The word जीवति is again read in this aphorism, though there is the _anuvritti_ of जीवति also from (IV. 1. 163). This जीवति of the _sutra_ qualifies the word descendant, the जीवति which is understood by context qualifies the word _sapinda_ thus :-

-	_Garga_ (dead) -> _Gargi_ (alive)
-	_Garga_ (dead) -> _Gargi_ (alive) -> _Gargya_ (alive)
-	_Garga_ (dead) -> _Gargi_ (alive) -> _Gargya_ (dead) -> _Gargyayna_) or _Gargya_ (alive)

Here the uncle or the brother of a grand-father being alive, the descendant is optionally called _Yuvan_ or _Gotra_.
