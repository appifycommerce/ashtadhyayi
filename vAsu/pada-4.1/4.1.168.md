sutra: जनपदशब्दात्क्षत्त्रियादञ्
vRtti: जनपदशब्दो यः क्षत्त्रियवाची तस्मादपत्ये ऽञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अञ् comes in the sense of a descendant, after a word, which while denoting a country, expresses also a tribe of _Kshatriyas_.

Thus पाञ्चालः 'the son of _Panchala_', so also ऐक्ष्वाकः and वैदेहः are _Kshatriyas_ who live in that country. Of course, when the word is only expressive of _Kshatriya_, but not of the name of a country, अञ् will not be used but अण्, the difference being in the accent. Thus द्रौह्यवः 'the son of '_Druhya_'; पौरवः 'the son of _Puru_.' Why do we say when it expresses _Kshatriyas_? Observe ब्राह्मणस्य पञ्चालस्यापत्यं = पाञ्चालिः, (IV. 1. 95) 'the son of _Panchala_ a _Brahmana_'; so also वैदेहिः ॥

Vart:- Let the same affix, which comes when the sense is that of the progeny, be added to a word denoting a country named after _Kshatriyas_, to denote the king thereof. Thus पंचालानाम् राजा = पाञ्चालः 'the king of the _Kshatriyas_ called _Panchala_ or of the country of _Panchalas_'. So also वैदेहः, 'the king of the _Kshatriyas_ or of the country of _Videha_'.

The words _Panchala_ &c. originally are names of _Kshatriya_ tribes only, secondarily they have been applied to the country inhabited by those tribes, because the _Taddhita_ affix denoting 'the country inhabited by them', is elided by (IV. 2. 81). Thus the same word पञ्चाल comes to denote the _Kshatriya_ tribe as well as the country called _Panchala_. It will make practically little difference to consider words like _Panchala_ &c. as original (not derivative) name of countries as well as of _Kshatriyas_. In fact, _Panini_ himself considers them in the same light in this _sutra_, and does not think them to be derivative words, in spite of his own _sutra_ (IV. 2. 81). Those words when denoting a country are always in the plural, as पञ्चालाः, in denoting the _Kshatriya_, they are in the singular.
