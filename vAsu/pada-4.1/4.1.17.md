sutra: प्राचां स्फ स्तद्धितः
vRtti: प्राचामाचार्याणां मतेन यञन्तात् स्त्रियां ष्फः प्रत्ययो भवति स च तद्धितसंज्ञः ॥
vRtti_eng: In the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians, the affix '_shpha_' is employed after what ends with the affix '_yan_', and it is to be regarded as a _Taddhita_ affix.

---
Of this affix ष्फ the letter ष् is indicatory (I.3.6), and shows that the words formed by this affix will take '_nish_' (IV.1.41). The feminine nature is here manifested by these two affixes jointly, viz by '_shpha_' and '_nish_'. The object of saying that '_shpha_' is to be regarded as a _taddhita_ affix, is that the word so formed may get the designation of _pratipadika_ (1. 2. 46). The affix फ is replaced by the substitute आयन (VII.1.2). Thus गार्ग्य + ष्फ + ङीष् = गार्ग्यायणी; so also वात्स्यायनी ॥ This being an optional rule, we have in the alternative, गार्गी and वात्सी ॥

The word  सर्वत्र "every where", of the next _sutra_ is to be read into this, by a process inverse to that of _anuvritti_, in order to prohibit the application of those rules even which would otherwise debar this. Thus (IV.1.75) says:- 'the affix चाप् comes after आवट्य' ॥ Here आवट्य ends in यञ्, and by (IV.1.16), the word आवट्य would have taken the affix nip: (IV.1.75) debarred this. But according to Eastern Grammarians, here also the affix '_shpha_' will be added. Thus आवट्यायनी ॥
