The affixes treated of in these six _sutras_ (4.1.168) to (4.1.173) are called _Tadraja_. The pronoun ते refers to these only and not to all the affixes treated or before S. (4.1.168); for they have the special designation of _Gotra_ and _Yuvan_ see (2.4.62). The illustrations of these have already been given under each of the above six aphorisms.
