vRtti_eng: "These (viz the affixes अञ् (IV. 1. 168) &c) are called _Tadraja_ ('the king there of') affixes."

The affixes treated of in these six _sutras_ (IV. 1. 168) to (IV. 1. 173) are called _Tadraja_. The pronoun ते refers to these only and not to all the affixes treated or before S. (IV. 1. 168); for they have the special designation of _Gotra_ and _Yuvan_ see (II. 4. 62). The illustrations of these have already been given under each of the above six aphorisms.
