sutra: कम्बोजाल्लुक्
vRtti: कम्बोजात् प्रत्ययस्य लुग् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the word '_Kamboja_', there is elision by '_luk_' of the _Tadraja_ affix.

---
Namely the affix अञ् which would have come after the word  कम्बोज because it denotes a country as well as a _Kshatriya_ tribe, is elided. Thus कम्बोजः 'The king of _Kamboja_'. 
It should be stated rather 'after _Kamboja_ and the like', because we find the affix elided after '_Chola_' &c. Thus चोलः 'the king of _Cholas_'. So also केरलः शकः यवनः ॥
