sutra: अतश्च
vRtti: अकारप्रत्ययस्य तद्राजस्य स्त्रियामभिधेयायां लुग्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In forming the feminine of a word which ends in the masculine in the _Tadraja_ affix अ, the affix is _luk_ elided_.

Thus m. शौरसेनः, f. शूरसेनी;  m. माद्रः j. मद्री ॥ The word अतः of the _sutra_ should not be construed by the rule of _tadanata_ _vidhi_ (1. 1. 72). If so construed it will mean "a _Tadraja_ affix ending in अ is elided". There have been taught five _Tadraja_ affixes, namely '_an_ अ)', '_an_ (अ)', 'nyan (य)', 'nya (य)' and 'in (इ)'. Of these the first four all end in अ; therefore all these four affixes should be elided in the feminine. But this is not the meaning of the author; for had it been so, there would have been no necessity of the previous _sutra_, for then the present _sutra_ would have covered the case of '_Avanti_', '_Kunti_' and '_Kuru_'. But the very fact of this _sutra_ (IV.1.176) indicates by ज्ञापक, that the _tadanta_ _vidhi_ does not apply here. Therefore, the feminine of आम्बष्ठ्यः is आम्बष्ठ्या, of सौवीर्यः is सौवीर्या ॥
