sutra: कौरव्यमाण्डूकाभ्यांच
vRtti: कौरव्य माण्डूक इत्येताभ्यां स्त्रियां ष्फः प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_shpha_' is added, in the feminine, after the words कौरव्य and माण्डूक ॥

---
The word कौरव्य is formed by adding the affix ण्य to the base कुरु (IV.1.151); this word, ending in अ, would have formed its feminine by टाप् (IV.1.4), but for the present _sutra_. So also by (IV.1.119), the word माण्डूक is formed by अण् added to मण्डूक; and the feminine of _manduka_ would have been formed by _nip_ (IV.1.15), but for the present aphorism, which supersedes that affix. Thus कौरव्यायणी, माण्डूकायनी ॥

How do you explain the form कौरवी in the phrase कौरवी सेना ?

We explain it by saying that कौरवी is not the feminine of कौरव्य; but of कौरव, formed by adding अण् to कुरु by _sutra_ (IV.3.120).

Vart:- The word आसुरि should be enumerated along with _kauravya_ and _mandukya_. Thus आसुरायणी ॥ The word आसुरि is formed by the affix इञ् added to the word असुर; the word '_asuri_' would, therefore have taken the affix अण्  in forming the further derivative (IV.2.112). But according to the opinion of _Patanjali_, the word, '_asuri_' should form its further derivative (called also शैषिक) by taking the affix छ (IV.2.114). Thus आसुरीयः कल्पः (तेन प्रोक्तम्) ॥
