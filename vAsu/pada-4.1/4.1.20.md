sutra: वयसि प्रथमे
vRtti: प्रथमे वयसि यत्प्रातिपदिकं श्रुत्यावर्त्तते ततः स्त्रियां ङीप् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ङीप् is employed, in the feminine, after a Nominal-stem ending in अ and denoting early age.

The word वयः means the condition of the body as dependent upon time; such as, youth, old age &c. Words expressive of early age form their feminine by ई, though ending in अ ॥ Thus, कुमारी 'a girl'. किशोरी 'a young girl' बर्करी 'a she-kid'.

Why do we say denoting 'early age?' Observe स्थविरा 'an old woman'; वृद्धा 'an old woman'. Why do we say ending in अ ? Observe शिशु, which is both masculine and feminine.

Vart:- The _sutra_ should have been आचरमे वयसि 'words expressive of not old age'? Thus वधूटी 'a young woman', चिरण्टी 'a young woman'. These words denote the second stage of life, and not the first, i. e. they denote women who have attained their maturity.

How do you explain the form कन्या 'a girl'? This is an exception, and _Panini_ himself uses the word '_kanya_' showing that it is a valid form; as in _sutra_ (IV. 1. 116).

The words like उत्तानशया 'an infant girl that does not know how to lie down properly' लोहितपादिका 'a female infant whose feet are still tender and red' do not directly, but metaphorically, express age, and hence are not governed by this rule.
