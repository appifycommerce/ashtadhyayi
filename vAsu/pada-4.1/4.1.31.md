sutra: रात्रेश्चाजसौ
vRtti: जस्विषयादन्यत्र संज्ञायां छन्दसि च रात्रिशब्दात् ङीप् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ङीप् comes after the word रात्रि in the _Chhandas_, and in denoting a Name, except when the affix जस् (nominative plural) is added.

Thus या रात्री सृष्टा, रात्रीभिः (3rd pl); (_Rigveda_ X. 127. I. I.35.1) but in the nominative plural we have रात्रयः, the regular plural of the word रात्रि, as in the sentence यास्ता रात्रयः, instead of रात्र्यः ॥

Vart:- According to _Katyayana_, _nip_ is not added, not only when we apply the nominative plural termination जस्; but in all other terminations beginning with जस् also. Thus रात्रिं सहोषित्वा; here in the accusative singular case also the ङीप् is not employed.

But how do you explain the form रात्र्यः in the following तिमिरपटलैरवगुण्ठिताश्च रात्र्यः; This '_ratrya_' is the nominative plural of '_ratri_' which is formed by the feminine affix _nip_; and not by _nish_. The forms evolved by adding ङीष् or ङीप् are one and the same, except with regard to accent; that formed by _nish_ has _udatta_ accent on the final: the other has it on the initial. The word रात्रि is formed by the _krit_ affix त्रिप् (_Un_. IV. 67), and therefore, it is a word which is governed by (IV.1.45) because it is a word falling in _Bahuvadi_ class, by virtue of the general subrule "a word ending with the vowel इ of a _krit_ affix, other than क्तिन् belongs to _Bahuvadi_ class; some say that every word ending in इ, if it has not the force of the affix क्तिन् belongs to this class". Therefore it takes ङीष् in forming the feminine.
