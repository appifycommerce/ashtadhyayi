sutra: पूतक्रतोरैच
vRtti: पूतक्रतुशब्दस्य स्त्रियामैकारादेशो भवति ङीप् प्रत्ययः ॥
vRtti_eng: In forming the feminine, the letter ऐ is the substitute of the final of the word पूतक्रतु, when the affix ङीप् is added.

Thus पूतक्रतायी 'the wife of _Putakratu_'. This and the two succeeding _sutras_, are in a way more intimately connected with (IV.1.48), in as much as the sense of the feminine words must be that of 'wife of', otherwise these _sutras_ will not apply. Thus if the meaning is not that of 'wife of', the word पूतक्रतुः will be both masculine and feminine as well, meaning 'she by whom sacrifices (क्रतवः) are sanctified (पूताः)'.
