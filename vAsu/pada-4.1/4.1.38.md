sutra: मनोरौवा
vRtti: मनुशब्दात् स्त्रियांङीप् प्रत्ययो भवति ओकारश्चन्तादेशः ऐकारश्चोदात्तः ॥
vRtti_eng: In forming the feminine with the affix ङीप्, औ is optionally the substitute of the final of मनु, (as well as the _udatta_ ऐ)  ॥

The phrases ऐ and उदात्त are understood. The force of वा is to make the substitution optional. Thus we have three forms, मनायी or मनावी or मनुः, all meaning 'the wife of _Manu_'. The word मनु has _udatta_ accent on the first vowel, as it is formed from मन् by the affix उ (_Un_ l. 10), which by _Un_ I. 9 is treated as having an indicatory म्, and affixes having indicatory न् throw the accent on the first syllable. (VI. I. 197)
