Thus of एत 'variegated'; the feminine is एता or एनी 'variegated', so श्येता or श्येनी 'black', हरिता or हरिणी 'green'. All these words have _udatta_ accent on the first vowel either by Rule (VI. 1. 197) (ञ्नित्यादिर्नित्यम् "word formed by affixes having an indicatory ञ् or न् have _udatta_ accent on the first vowel":) because these words are formed by the _Unadi_ affixes तन् (_Un_ III. 86) and इतन् (III. 93), or by the _Phit_ _sutra_ 11. 10 (वर्णानां तणतिनितान्तानाम् "of words expressive of colour and ending in तण, or ति or नि or त, the _udatta_ accent falls on the first vowel").

Why do we say "expressive of color"? Observe प्रहृता, प्ररुता ॥ These words are also acutely accented on the first syllable, by rule (VI. 2. 49) (गतिरनन्तरः "the first word retains its natural accent in a compound of a _gati_ word with a word formed by the affix _kta_"). But as these words do not express color, their feminine does not take _nip_.

Why do we say "ending in a gravely accented vowel?" Observe श्वेता 'white'. Here though the word expresses 'color', yet it has acute (instead of grave) accent on the final (by rule of _Phit_ _sutra_ I. 21 घृतादीनां च "the words _ghrita_ &c. have _udatta_ on the final").

Why do we say "having the letter त as its penultimate letter"?  Otherwise the affix _nish_ will be employed in forming the feminine.

The words for the application of this rule must end in the letter अ in the masculine. Otherwise this rule will not apply. As शितिर्ब्राह्मणी 'a black _Brahmani_ woman'. Here शिति is a word expressive of color, it has a penultimate त, has _anudatta_ accent on the final (VI. 1. 197) as it is formed by the affix क्तिन्; but as it does not end with अ, its feminine is not formed with _nip_.

Vart:- The affix _hip_ comes also after the word पिशङ्ग; as, पिशङ्गी 'of tawny color'.

Vart:- There is prohibition in the case of the words असित and पलित; as असिता 'black' and पलिता 'grey'.

Vart:- According to some, the substitute क्नम् replaces the final of these two words असित and पलिता in the Vedic literature. As आसिक्नी (_Rig_ _Veda_ IX. 73. 29); पलिक्नी (_R_. _Veda_ V. 2. 4). According to some authorities, these latter forms are valid in literature other than the Vedic:- As गतो गणस्तूर्णमसिक्निकानाम् ॥
