sutra: अजाद्यतष्टाप्
vRtti: अजादिभ्यः प्रातिपदिकेभ्योऽकारान्ताच्च प्रातिपदिकात् स्त्रियां टाप् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix टाप् is employed to indicate feminine nature, after the Nominal-stem \"_aja_\" &c, and after the stems ending in short अ ॥
---
Of the affix टाप्, the letters ट् and प् are इत्, the real affix is आ ॥ The letter प् indicates that the affix has _anudatta_ accent (III. 1. 4); the letter ट् is employed to distinguish this affix from चाप् and डाप् ॥

The words अज &c, are given below. Thus अज 'a he goat,' अजा 'a she goat'. The words ending in short अ are such as, देवदत्त whose feminine will be देवदत्ता ॥ The word अत् is used in the aphorism, the indicatory त् shows (I. I. 70) that the short अ having one _matra_ should be taken; and not the long आ ॥ _Pratipadikas_ that end in long आ, such as कीलालपा or शुभंया (III. 2. 74) do not form their feminine by taking टाप्, but are both masculine and feminine. Thus, शुभंयाः कीलालपाः ब्राह्मणी 'the auspicious-going, nectar-drinking _Brahmani_'. Had the feminine of such words been formed by टाप्, then the case-affix स् of the nominative singular would have been elided after them (VI. 1. 68).

Following are the words belonging to the अजादि class:--

1. अज अजा 2. एडक एडका 3. कोकिल कोकिला
4. चटक चटका 5. अश्व अश्वा 6. मूषिक मूषिका

N. B. The above words denote '_jati_' or kind and though they end in short अ in the masculine, they would have taken, but for the present _sutra_, the affix '_nish_' (IV. 2. 63) in the feminine.

7. बाल बाला 8. होड होडा 9. पाक पाका
10. वत्स वत्सा 11. मन्द मन्दा 12. विलात विलाता

N. B. The above six words are descriptive of age, and though they end in short अ in the masculine, but for the present _sutra_, they would have taken the affix 'ङीप्' (IV. 1. 20) in the feminine.

13. पूर्वापहरण, पूर्वापहरणा; 14. अपरापहारण अपरापहारणा;

N. B. These two words are formed by the affix ल्युट्, and being टित् would have taken ङीप् (IV. 1. 15) but for this _sutra_.

15. संफल,  संफला;  16. भस्त्रफल; भस्त्रफला;
17. अजिनफल, अजिनफला; 18. शणफल, शणफला;
19. पिण्डफल, पिण्डफला; 20. त्रिफल, त्रिफला;

N. B. The above words ending in '_phala_' would have taken the affix _nish_ (IV. I. 64) but for their enumeration in the '_ajadi_' class; 'त्रिफला' when a _Dvigu_ Compound forms its feminine as त्रिफला; when a _Bahuvrihi_ Compound, its feminine is त्रिफली ॥

21. सत्पुष्प, सत्पुश्पा; 22. प्राक्पुष्प, प्राक्पुष्पा;
23. काण्डपुष्प, काण्डपुष्पा; 24. प्रान्तपुष्प, प्रान्तपुष्पा;
25. शतपुष्प, शतपुष्पा; 26. एकपुष्प, एकपुष्पा;

The above words ending in पुष्प would have taken _nish_ by (IV. 1. 64).

27. शूद्र शूद्रा

B. N. But the feminine of शूद्र is शूद्री when the meaning is 'the wife of a _sudra_'; so also when the word शूद्र is compounded with the word महत् as, महाशूद्री 'a woman of 'महाशूद्र' class'.

The term 'महाशूद्र' is applied to the caste of _Abhiras_: and this compound word would have taken the affix 'टाप्' by the rule of _tadanta_ _vidhi_ given in (I. 1. 72), but for the _vartika_, viz 'शूद्रा चामहत पूर्वा जातिः' It might be objected that the _tadanta_ _vidhi_ cannot apply here on the strength of the following maxim:- “That which cannot possibly be anything but a _pratipadika_ does not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself”. Therefore, the word '_sudra_' which cannot be anything but a _pratipadika_, does not denote '_maha_-_sudra_'. This objection is futile: the very fact of this _vartika_ indicates by implication (_jnapaka_), that with regard to the application of the feminine affixes, the _tadanta_-_vidhi_ is valid and does apply. Thus we have the forms like अतिधीवरी अतिपीवरी and अतिभवती

28. क्रुंच् क्रुंचा 29. उष्णिह् उष्णिहा 30. देवविश् देवविशा  

N. B. The above words end in consonants and would not have taken 'टाप्' but for their being included in the 'अजादि' class.

31. ज्येष्ठ ज्येष्ठा 32. कनिष्ठ कनिष्ठा 33. मध्यम मध्यमा

B. N. The above words denoting matrimonial realtion would have taken the affix '_nish_' by (IV. 1. 46).

34. अमूल अमूला The word '_mula_' preceded by the negative particle _nan_, would have otherwise taken '_nish_' by (IV. 1. 64).
