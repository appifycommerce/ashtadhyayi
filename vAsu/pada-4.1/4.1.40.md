sutra: अन्यतोङीष्
vRtti: वर्णवाचिनः प्रातिपदिकादनुदात्तान्तात् स्त्रियां ङीष् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ङीष् is employed in the feminine after every other word expressive of color and ending with an _anudatta_ accent.

---
The word वा of (IV.1.38) does not govern this _sutra_. The word अन्यतः means in other cases than those governed by the last aphorism i.e. after words which have not त as penultimate. The difference between _nip_ and _nish_ affixes consists in accent, the former being gravely accented (111. 1. 4) and the latter acute. Thus सारङ्गी, कल्माषी, शबली ॥

When the word does not express color, this rule does not apply. As खट्वा 'a bed-sted'.

When the word does not end with a gravely accented vowel, this will not apply, as, कृष्णा , कपिला ॥
