Thus शोणी or शोणा वडवा 'a red or bay mare'. By _Phit_ _Sutra_ II. 10 referred to already in (4.1.39) the _udatta_ in शोणा falls on the first syllable, and by (4.1.40) it would have taken ङीष् always; but the present _sutra_ makes a _niyama_ rule and restricts the application of ङीष् according to the opinion of Eastern Grammarians only, and not of others.
