sutra: इन्द्रवरुणभवशर्वरुद्रमृडहिमारण्ययव यवनमातुलाचार्याणामानुक्
vRtti: इन्द्रादिभ्यः प्रातिपदिकेभ्यः स्त्रियां ङीष् प्रत्ययो भवति आनुक् चागमः ॥
vRtti_eng: null

The augment आनुक् is added to the Proper Nouns इन्द्र, वरुण, भव, शर्व, रुद्र, and मृड, and to the words हिम 'snow', अरण्य 'a forest', यव 'barley', यवन 'a _Yavana_', मातुल 'a maternal uncle', and आचार्य 'a preceptor', before the feminine affix ङीष् ॥

The present _sutra_ teaches two things, the addition of the augment आनुक् (आन्) and secondly the feminine affix ङीष् ॥ Out of the above words, in case of those about which matrimonial relation is desired to be expressed, i. e. the Proper Nouns up to मृड, the present _sutra_ teaches only the addition of the augment आनुक्, for in their case, the affix ङीष् would follow by force of the preceding _Sutra_. In the case of the remaining words, it teaches both these things.
Thus इन्द्राणी 'the wife of _Indra_', वरुणानी 'the wife of _Varuna_',  भवानी 'the wife of _Bhava_', शर्वाणी 'the wife of _Sarva_', रुद्राणी 'the wife of _Rudra_', मृडानि 'the wife of _Mrida_'.

Vart:- Of the words हिम and अरण्य, there is the augment अनुक् in the sense of greatness. Thu हिमानी 'a glacier, much snow', अरण्यानी 'a great forest'. Otherwise these words are always Neuter and never take feminine·

Vart:- After the word यव 'barley' the feminine affix and the augment are added in the sense of fault. The fault consists in its imitating barley while not being a barley. In fact the word denotes a new and inferior sort of grain. Thus यवानी "a kind of grain, oat".

Vart:- After the word यवन, the affix and the augment are added in the sense of handwriting. Thus यवनानी 'the written character of the _Yavanas_'.

Vart:- Of the words मातुल 'a maternal uncle', and उपाध्याय 'a preceptor', when the feminine affix comes to express the wife thereof, the augment आनुक् is optional. Thus मतुलानी or मातुली 'the wife of a maternal uncle' उपाध्यायानी or उपाध्यायी 'the wife of a preceptor'.

Vart:- And there is not the change to the lingual ण् of the dental न् of the augment आनुक् (8.4.2) after the word आचार्य ॥ Thus आचार्यानी or आचार्या 'the wife of a preceptor'.

Vart:- After the words अर्य and क्षत्रिय this rule applies optionally : when the matrimonial relation is not intended but the word retains its own sense. Thus अर्याणी or अर्या 'the female of the _Arya_ or _Vaishya_ class', क्षत्रियाणी or क्षत्रिया 'a female of the _Kshatriya_ class'. When matrimonial relation is to be expressed, then only ङीष् is added. As अर्यी 'the wife of a _Vaishya_', क्षत्रियी 'the wife of a _Kshatriya_'.

Vart:- In the _Chhandas_, the affix ङीष् with the augment आनुक् is added to the word मुद्गल; and the affix is treated as if it had an indicatory ल् ॥ The force of the indicatory ल् is to make the vowel preceding the affix, take the acute accent (6.1.193 लिति). Thus रथीरभून् मुद्गलानी गविष्टौ ॥ (_Rig_ _Veda_ X. 102. 2).
