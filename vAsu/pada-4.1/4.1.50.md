sutra: क्रीतात्करणपूर्वात्
vRtti: क्रीतशब्दान्तात् प्रातिपदिकात् करणपूर्वात् स्त्रियां ङीष् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ङीष् is employed in the feminine after a compound word ending in क्रीत, the first member of the compound being the name of the means wherewith the thing is bought.

The word करणपूर्वम् means that compound in which the करण or 'means' is the first member. Thus वस्त्रक्रीती 'a female bought in exchange for cloth'; so also वसनक्रीती 'a female bought in exchange for dress'.

Why do we say "when the first member of the compound is the name of the means" ? Observe सुक्रीता 'well purchased', दुष्क्रीता 'ill-purchased'. But why is not the affix ङीष् employed in धनक्रीता in the following verse :-- सा हितस्यधनक्रीता प्राणेभ्योपि गरीयसी 'she purchased in exchange of riches is more dear to him than life'. Here the word क्रीत has first taken the affix टाप् forming क्रीता and then this feminine word is compounded with धन ॥ The general rule is गतिकारकोपपदानां कृद्भिः सहसमासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः "_Gati_, _Karakas_ and _Upapadas_ are compounded with bases that end with _Krit_-affixes, before a case termination or a feminine affix has been added to the latter". The word धनक्रीता is an exception, founded on the diversity allowed by कर्तृकरणे कृता बहुलम् (II.1.32).
