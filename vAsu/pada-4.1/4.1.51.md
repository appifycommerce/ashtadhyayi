sutra: क्तादल्पाख्यायाम्
vRtti: करणपूर्वात्प्रातिपदिकात् क्तान्तदल्पाख्यायां ङीष् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ङीष् is employed after a compound Nominal-stem in which a name denoting the means wherewith, is the first member, and the second member is a word formed by the Participle क्त, when the sense is that of 'a small quantity'.

The word करण पूर्वात् 'preceded by a noun denoting the means where with', of the last _sutra_ governs this also. The participle in क्त, must be preceded by a noun in the instrumental case, and the sense conveyed by क्त, to the action should give the sense of 'little', in connection therewith. The अल्पाख्यायाम् of the _sutra_ qualifies the whole word. Thus अभ्रविलिप्ती द्यौः 'a sky covered slightly with clouds', सूपविलिप्ती पात्री 'a dish slightly covered with soup'.

Why do we say when the sense is that of 'little'? Observe चन्दनानुलिप्ता ब्राह्मणी "a _Brahmani_ lady covered with sandal essence?"
