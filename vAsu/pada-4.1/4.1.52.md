sutra: बहुव्रीहेश्चान्तोदात्तात्
vRtti: बहुव्रीहिर्योऽन्तोदात्तस्तस्मान् स्त्रियां ङीष् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ङीष् is employed in the feminine after that _Bahuvrihi_ compound, which ending with a word formed by the affix क्त, has an acute accent on the last syllable.

The word क्तात् of the last aphorism governs this also. This _sutra_ applies to those _Bahuvrihi_ compounds in which the first member is a _svanga_ word. But if the antecedent member is not a _svanga word_, then the application of the rule is optional. As शंखभिन्नी 'having a rent on the temporal bone', ऊरुभिन्नी 'having a rent on the thigh'. गलकोत्कृन्नी (गलमुत्कृत्तमस्या), केशलूनी ॥ By (II. 2. 36) _ Vart _ जातिकालसुखादिश्यः परवचनम्, the _Nishtha_ stands in the second place, otherwise by (II. 2. 36) it ought to have formed the first member of the compound. The words शंख &c. are _jati_ words, and by (VI. 2. 170), the acute is on the final.

Why do we say "after a _Bahuvrihi_ compound ?" Observe पादपतिता which is an Ablative _Tatpurusha_ compound (II. 2. 38). The compounding is by (II. 1. 32), and it has acute on the final by (VI. 2. 144).

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the participle जात 'born', which is also acutely accented on the final. Thus दन्तजाता 'a female who has cut her teeth;' स्तनजाता 'a female whose breast has been developed'. See (II. 2. 36) _Vart_.

Vart:- In the case of words पाणिगृहीती &c, the affix is employed in certain senses only. Thus पाणिगृहीती 'a wife'; (अग्निसाक्षिकं यस्याः पाणिर्गृह्यते); but पाणिगृहीता 'a woman whose hands have been taken, but not before the sacred fire, a concubine &c.'

Vart:- Exception must be stated in the case of compounds, the antecedent member of which is any one of the following words :- बहु, नञ, सु, words denoting time, सुख &c. Thus बहुकृता, अकृता, सुकृता, मासजाता, संवत्सरजाता, सुखजाता or दुःखजाता &c.

_Bahuvrihi_ compounds get acute accent on the final syllable when they fall under the rules (VI. 2. 170) and the following.
