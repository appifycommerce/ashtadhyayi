sutra: दिक्पूर्वपदान् ङीप्
vRtti: दिक् पूर्वपदात्प्रातिपदिकात् ङीप्, प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The feminine affix ङीप् comes after a Nominal-stem which is preceded by a word signifying direction.

This aphorism over-rules all the rules and prohibitions contained in _sutras_ (IV.1.54) to (IV.1.58). Whereever by those rules there would have been ङीष्, the present enjoins ङीप् instead. Though the form will be the same, the difference will be in the accent; the affix ङीप् being _anudatta_ (III.1.4). Thus प्राङ्मुखी or प्राङ्मुखा, प्राङ्नासिकी or प्रांनासिका, But not so in प्राग्गुल्फा; प्राक्क्रोडा or प्राग्जघना because these words do not take ङीष् (by (IV. I. 56)), therefore they never give occasion to the application of ङीप् ॥ The _sutra_ ought to be read as if it contained two rules (1) the affix ङीष् comes after a compound the first member of which is a word denoting direction and the second is a _svanga_ word or is the word नासिका &c. the penultimate not being a conjunct consonant, (2) but ङीष् is not added to Compounds ending in क्रोड &c. or in a word of more than two syllables. In other words the _sutra_ may be translated "ङीप् is the substitute of ङीष् when the first member is a word denoting direction". Therefore the affix ङीप् will come only there, where else the affix ङीष् would have come and not otherwise. This is the reason why the _anuvritti_ of ङीष् is taken in the next _sutra_ (IV.1.61) and not that of ङीप् ॥
