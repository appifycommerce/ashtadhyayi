sutra: ऊङुतः
vRtti: उकारान्तान्मनुष्यजातिवाचिनः प्रातिपदिकात् स्त्रियामूङ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a Nominal-stem ending in short उ, not having the letter य् as its penultimate letter, and being expressive of races of men, the affix in the feminine is ऊङ्.

The _anuvritti_ of the words मनुष्यजाति and अयोपधात् should be read into the _sutra_ to complete it. Thus कूरूः 'a female of the country of the _Kurus_' ब्रह्मबन्धूः "a _Brahmani_ of the class of the fallen _Brahmans_ so called", जीवबन्धूः "a woman of the _Jivabandhu_ class”.

Thus कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः (IV. 1. 172), and this affix is elided by (IV. 1. 176) in the feminine.

The indicatory letter ङ् in ऊङ् is to distinguish this affix in _Sutras_ like नोङ् धात्वोः (VI. 1. 175), for had the affix been enunciated merely as ऊ, then the _Sutra_ (VI. 1.175) would have run as नो धात्वोः and the sense would have been ambiguous, for we could not have known what affix was particularly meant there.

The long ऊ is taught to debar the affix कप्, for a short उ would have also given the form करू (कुरु + उ = कुरू) ॥ The long ऊ therefore, indicates that the affix कप्, enjoined by (V. 4. 154), in _Bahuvrihis_, will not apply in the feminine forms ब्रह्मबन्धूः and the like, by the rule of _vipratishedha_.

Why do we say "not having the letter य् as its penultimate"? Witness अध्वर्युर्ब्राह्मणी 'a woman of the class of _Brahmanas_ versed in the _Yajur_ _Veda_'.

Vart:- The affix ऊङ् comes under similar conditions after words denoting non-animate _jati_, except the words रज्जु &c. Thus अलाबूः 'the bottle gourd'; कर्कन्धूः 'the jujube tree.' Why do we say "non-animate"? Witness कृकवाकुः 'a kind of lizard.' Why do we say "except the word _rajju_ &c" Witness रज्जुः 'rope'; हनुः 'cheek' &c.
