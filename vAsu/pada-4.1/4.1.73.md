sutra: शार्ङ्गरवाद्यञो ङीन्
vRtti: शार्ङ्गरवादिभ्योऽञन्तेभ्यश्च प्रातिपदिकेभ्यः स्त्रियां ङीन् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The feminine affix ङीन् comes after the words शार्ङ्गरव and the rest, and that which ends with the affix अञ् ॥

Thus शार्ङ्गरवी 'a _Sarngrava_ woman', कापटवी 'a _Kapatava_ woman'. So also after a word formed with the affix अञ् (as ordained in S. 86, and 104 &c. of this chapter), as, बैदी 'a female descendant of _Bida_'. और्वी 'a female descendant of _Urva_'. This _sutra_ applies to words expressing _jati_ or kind. In other words, this aphorism debars the affix ङीष् of (IV.1.63) &c. where it came after _jati_-_vachaka_ words; but it does not debar that ङीष् which is employed in describing the relation of wife, such as, the ङीष् of (IV.1.48).

The difference between ङीष् and ङीन् consists in accent only, the resultant forms otherwise being the same. The words formed by ङीन् will have _udatta_ accent on the first syllable ञ्नित्यादिर्नित्यम् ((VI.1.197) a word ending with an affix having an indicatory ञ् or न् has _udatta_ accent on the first syllable') : while the word formed by ङीष् will have acute accent on the affix. Thus बैदी 'a female descendant of _Bida_', and बैदी 'the wife of _Baida_'.

The following is a list of _Sarngaravadi_ class words:-

1 शार्गंरव, 2 कापटव, 3 गौग्गुलव, 4 ब्राह्मण, 5 बैद, 6 गौतम ॥ These words are formed by the affix अण् the first four being formed by the अण् of ( IV.1.83) from शृंगरु, कपटु, गुग्गुलु and ब्रह्मन्; the word गौतम is formed from गोतम by the अण् of (IV.1.114). This word is also included in _Gauradi_ class (IV.1.41). 7 कामण्डलेय, 8 ब्राह्मकृतेव, 9 आनिचेय, 10 आनिधेय, 11 आशीकेय ॥ These are formed by ढक् (IV.1.123) except _kamandaleya_ which is formed by ढञ् (IV.1.135). 12 वात्स्यायन, 13 मौञ्जायन ॥ These are formed by फक् of (IV. I. 101) and (IV.1.99), and denote castes or _Gotra_. 14 कैकसेय is also formed by ढक् (IV.1.123). 15 काव्य 16 शैव्य are formed by ञ्यङ् (IV.1.171). 17 एहि, 18 पर्येहि are formed by इन् added to आ + इह् 'to try', and परि + आ + इह् (_Un_ IV. 117 सर्व धातुभ्य इन्) 19 आश्मरथ्य is formed by यञ् (IV.1.105). 20 औदपान is formed by अण् (IV.3.76). 21 अराल, 22 चण्डाल, 23 वतण्डः are _jati_ words. 24 भोगवत्, 25 गौरिमत् ॥ These take ङ्गीन् when denoting a Name. These words are formed by the affix मतुप्, and are consequently उगित्, and should have taken ङीप् (IV.1.6). This ordains ङीन् ॥

Q. The word भोग is formed by घञ् and गौरि is formed by इञ् (IV.1.95), both are _adyuddatta_ owing to ञ् (VI.1.197). When मतुप् is added, the accent remains unchanged, for _matup_ being पित् is _anudatta_ (I11. 1. 4). Therefore whether ङीप् be added or ङीन् to these words, it makes no difference in the accent, for they remain _adyudatta_. Where is the necessity of including these two words in this list.

Ans. To this we reply घादिषु नित्यम् हृस्वार्थम् ॥ For had these words taken ङीप् of (IV.1.6), then the long ई would have been optionally shortened before the affixes घ &c. by (VI.3.45). But by taking ङीन् the shortening is compulsory (VI.3.43), and not optional. Because the च in the _sutra_ उगितश्च (VI.3.45) has the force of the word इति, and means the नदी words formed by adding ई to उगित् words, by enunciating the word उगित् are optionally shortened. Therefore (IV.1.6) where the word उगित् is used is governed by this rule of optional shortening, and not the words formed by ङीन् ॥

26 नृ 27 नर. The word नृ would have taken ङीप् by (IV.1.5), and नर would have taken ङीष् as it denotes a _jati_. These words take _vriddhi_ before ङीन्, the form being नारी in both cases.
