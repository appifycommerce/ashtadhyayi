This is an _adhikara_ or governing _sutra_. Up to the end of the Fifth Book, all the affixes that will be taught, are to be understood to have the name of _Taddhita_. Thus the affix ति taught in the very next _sutra_. As युवतिः The word so formed is called _Pratipadika_. The word तद्धिताः is in the  number, and not exhibited in the singular, like the words प्रत्ययः (III. I. 1) &c; and it, therefore, indicates that it includes also affixes which are not especially taught in this book. Such as पृथिव्य ञाञौ॥ अग्रादि पश्चाड् डिमच् ॥ As पार्थिव, अग्रिम, आदिम, पश्चिम ॥ See _Vart_ IV.3.23. The word _Taddhita_ is used in _Sutras_ like कृत्तद्धितसमासाश्च (I.2.46).
