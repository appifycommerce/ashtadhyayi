sutra: प्राग्दिव्यतोऽण्
vRtti: प्राग्दीव्यत्संशब्दनाद् यानित ऊर्ध्वमनुक्रमिष्यामोऽण्प्रत्ययस्तत्र भवतीति वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् should be understood to come after whatever we shall teach hereafter upto the aphorism _tena_ _divyati_ &c.

Up to aphorism (4.4.2), the affix अण् has a governing influence, except where it is specifically superseded by any particular rule. This aphorism may be looked upon either as an _adhikara_ _sutra_ or a _paribhasha_ _sutra_ or a _vidhi_ _sutra_. The application of this aphorism will be illustrated throughout the next three chapters. Thus in (4.1.92) तस्यापत्यम् we read the present aphorism and add the affix अण् in the sense of 'his son'. As औपगवः 'the son of उपगुः'; कापटवः 'the son of _Kapatu_'.

This affix has various meanings, such as, a patronymic (4.1.92), coloured with (4.2.1), sidereal time (4.1.3), revealed _sama_-_veda_ (4.1.7), covered car (4.2.10) &c.
