sutra: दित्यदित्यादित्यपत्त्युत्तरपदाण्ण्यः
vRtti: दिति अदिति आदित्य इत्येतेभ्यः पत्युत्तरपदाच्च प्रातिपदिकात्प्राग्दीव्यतीयेष्वर्थेषु ण्यः प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ण्य comes, in the various senses taught here-in-after antecedently to _tena_ _divyati_ &c, after the Proper Names, _Diti_, _Aditi_, and _Aditya_; and that which has the word पति at its final member.

---
Thus दिति + ण्य = दैत्यः 'the son of _Diti_.' आदित्यः 'the descendant of _Aditi_', आदित्यम् ' sacred to _Aditya_.' Similarly with words ending with पति, as प्रजापति + ण्य = प्राजापत्यं; so also सैनापत्यम् ॥

Vart:- So also after the word यम; as याम्यम् ॥

Vart:- In the _Chhandas_, after the words वाच्, मति and पितृमत् ॥ As वाच्यम् (_Vs_, 13, 58.) मात्यम् and पैतृमत्यम् ॥

Vart:- The affixes ञ् and अञ् come after the word पृथिवी ॥ Thus पृथिवी + ञ = पार्थिव; पृथिवी + अञ् = पार्थिव ॥ The resulting forms are the same, but the feminine of the former will be पार्थिवा by (IV. I. 4), and that of the latter पार्थिवी applying (IV.1.15).

Vart:- The affixes यञ् and अञ् come after the word देव 'a god'. As दैव्यम् or दैवम् 'divine'.

Vart:- There is elision of the टि of बहिस्, and there is the affix यञ्; as बहिस् + यञ् = बाह्यः 'external'. Vart:- and the affix ईकक् may be employed. As बहिस् + ईकक् = बाहिकः 'external'. (VII.2.118 किति च, there is _vriddhi_ of the first vowel when the _Taddhita_ affix has an indicatory क्). Vart:- In the _Chhandas_ it takes the affix ईकञ् as बाहिकः the difference being in the accent (VI.1.197).

The word बहिस् is an अव्यय, and the above _vartika_ declares that its टि portion is elided. This very fact indicates by implication, that the टि of other _Avyayas_ need not necessarily be elided before those affixes, before which the base is called भ _bha_. In fact the following _vartika_ अव्यायानाञ्च (the टि of the _avyaya_ base is elided) given under (sutra_ (VI.4.144) (the टि of the base _bha_ is elided when a _taddhita_ affix follows) is not a universal rule. Thus from the _avyaya_ आरात् we get आराती &c; here the टि is not elided.

Vart:- Of the word स्थामन् the टि is replaced by अ as अश्वत्थामः ॥

Vart:- The टि of लोमन् is replaced by ञ in the plural when the patronymic affixes follow; as उडुलोमाः, शरलोमाः ॥ Why do we say in the plural number ? Witness औडुलोमिः, शारलोमिः (IV.1.99).

Vart:- When an affix beginning with a vowel presents itself after the word गो, let the affix यत् be substituted for it. Thus what is descended (or produced, &c) from गो is expressed by गव्यम् (VI.1.79). Why do we say 'beginning with a vowel' ? Observe गोभ्यो हितं or आगतं = गोरूप्यम् and गोमयम् ॥

Vart:- These affixes ण्य &c, taught in this _sutra_ will come, to the exclusion of all the other affixes hereinafter taught, which are employed in especial senses. Thus अण् is employed especially to denote a descendant. But after the words दिति &c अण् will not be employed, but ण्य, as दैत्य 'a descendant of दिति'. So also वानस्पत्यम् = (वनस्पतीनाम् समुहः), to the exclusion of (IV.2.37) &c. In fact the rule for विप्रतिषेधे परंकार्य्यम् (I.4.2) does not hold good here.

If that be so, how do you explain the form दैतेयः ॥ This word is not directly formed from the word दिति but from दिती, the feminine of the word दिति, formed by the affix ङीष् (IV.1.45), the word दिति being formed by the _Krit_ affix क्तिन् and therefore it will take ङीष् in the feminine). To the feminine word दिती is added ढक् and we get दैतेयः ॥ The _Paribhasha_ प्रातिपदिकग्रहणे लिङ्ग विशिष्टस्यापि ग्रहणम् (a rule of grammar which applies to a masculine applies also to the same word in the feminine) is not of universal application, as this very illustration shows. Others consider the form दैतेय as incorrect, as not to be found either in the _Mahabhashya_ or any _Vartika_.
