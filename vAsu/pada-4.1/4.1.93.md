sutra: एको गोत्रे
vRtti: अपत्यं पौत्रप्रभृति गोत्रं, तस्मिन् विवक्षिते भेदेन प्रत्यपत्यं प्रत्ययोत्पत्तिप्रसङ्गे नियमः क्रियते । गोत्रे एक एव भवति, सर्वेऽपत्येन युज्यन्ते ॥
vRtti_eng: The one and the same affix is employed when a more distant descendant, how low so-ever, is to be denoted.

The word _Gotra_ is defined in _Sutra_ (IV.1.152) and means the offspring beginning with the grandson. There would have arisen the application of a separate affix in denoting the descendant of every one of such persons; the present _sutra_ declares a restriction. Thus the son of गर्गः is गार्गि (IV.1.95). The son of गार्गिः (or in other words the grandson of गर्ग) is गार्ग्यः (IV.1.105). This is formed by a _Gotra_ affix. Now the son of गार्ग्यः will also be called गार्ग्यः, no new affix will be added. In fact, in denoting the _Gotra_ descendants how low soever, the affix यञ् will be added to the word गर्ग, though there may be several intermediate descendants. Thus the _sutra_ restricts the application of the affix. Or in another view of the matter, it may be said to restrict the base to which the affix is to be added. Thus the son of गार्ग्य will be formed by adding the affix यञ् not to the base गार्ग्य (which would have been the case were (IV.1.92) strictly applied), but to the base गर्ग ॥ So that one base is to be taken and adhered to throughout, in applying _Gotra_ affixes.
