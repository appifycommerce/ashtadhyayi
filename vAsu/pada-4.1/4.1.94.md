sutra: गोत्राद्यून्यस्त्रियाम्
vRtti: अयमपि नियमः यून्यपत्ये विवक्षिते गोत्रादेव प्रत्ययो भवति, न परमप्रकृत्यनन्तरयुवभ्यः ॥
vRtti_eng: When a descendant of the description denoted by _Yuvan_ (IV. 1. 163) is intended to be expressed, a new affix is attached, only after what already ends with an affix marking a descendant as low at least as a grandson (_gotra_) : but in the Feminine the word is not termed _Yuvan_, and no new affix is added.

This is also a _niyama_ or restrictive rule. Thus the _Yuvan_ of गार्ग्य is गार्ग्यायणः (IV. 1. 101). Similarly वात्स्यायणः, दाक्षायणः, प्लाक्षायणः, औपगविः, नाडायनिः ॥

Why do we say "but in the Feminine the word is not termed _Yuvan_"? Observe दाक्षी which is the feminine of दाक्षिः (_Gotra_) as well as of दाक्षायणः (_Yuvan_). Similarly प्लाक्षी feminine of प्लाक्षिः and प्लाक्षायणः ॥ In short, _Yuvan_ affixes are not added in the feminine. If it is intended to denote a feminine descendant of the kind _Yuvan_, the feminine word formed by _Gotra_ affix will denote such a descendant also.

What is here prohibited i. e. is the term _Gotra_ superseded by the term _Yuvan_? If it is a _niyama_ rule, there will be no _niyama_ with regard to the feminine, as the prohibition is contained in the same sentence. Therefore in the feminine, the _Yuvan_ affix will not get the designation of _Gotra_, because _Gotra_-name is debarred by _Yuvan_ Name. Therefore the _sutra_ should be divided in two, e. g. गोत्राद् यूनि प्रत्ययो भवति (2) ततोऽस्त्रियाम् ॥ (1) After a _Gotra_ formed word a new affix is added in denoting a _Yuvan_ descendant, (2) but not so in the feminine. In fact the name _Yuvan_ is prohibited in the feminine, therefore, the feminine will be known _Gotra_ always and never by _Yuvan_.
