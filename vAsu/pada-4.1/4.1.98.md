sutra: गोत्रे कुञ्जादिभ्यश्च् फञ्
vRtti: गोत्रसंज्ञके ऽपत्ये वाच्ये कुंजादिभ्यश्च्फञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix '_chphan_' comes after the words '_Kunja_' &c, when a remoter descendant (called _Gotra_) is to be denoted."
---
This debars इञ् ॥ Of the affix च्फञ् the letter ञ् is for the sake of distinguishing this affix from the affix फञ्; such as in _sutra_ (V. 3. 113), by which the words ending in affix च्फञ् take the further affix य (ञ्य), in order to form a complete word. The letter ञ् of this affix causes _Vriddhi_ (VII. 2. 117). Then remains फ् which by _sutra_ (VII. 1. 2), is replaced by आयन् ॥ Thus कुञ्ज + च्फञ् = कौञ्ज + आयन् + अ = कौञ्जायन. This is not a complete word as yet. We must add य by _sutra_ (V. 3. 113). Thus the full word is कौञ्जायन्यः 'the grandson or a lower descendant of _Kunja_' dual of it is कौञ्जायन्यौ, plural is कौञ्जायनाः; the affix ञ्य being elided by (II. 5. 62), in the plural, it being an affix of the तद्राज class (IV. 1. 174). Similarly ब्राध्रायन्यः, ब्राध्रायन्यौ, ब्राध्रायनाः ॥

Why do we say "when a _Gotra_ descendant is to be denoted?" Observe कौंजिः "the son of _Kunja_". Here इञ् is added by (IV. 1. 95) in denoting immediate descendant. There is difference in the accent of these words, in the different numbers. Thus in the singular and dual, the accent will be regulated by the latter ञ् of the affix ञ्य which is added in those numbers. But this affix being elided in the plural, the accent there will be regulated by the letter च of च्फञ् ॥ That is to say, in the singular and dual, the _udatta_ will fall on the first syllable (VI. 1. 197); in the plural, it will fall on the last syllable (VI. 1. 164).

The word गोत्रे of this _sutra_ governs the succeeding _sutras_ up to aphorism (IV. 1. 112): so that all the affixes taught in these fifteen _sutras_ denote grandsons or descendants lower than that.
