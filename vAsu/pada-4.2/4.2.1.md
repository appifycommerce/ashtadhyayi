sutra: तेन रक्तं रागात्
vRtti: तेनेति तृतीयासमर्थाद्रागविशेषवाचिनः शब्दाद्रक्तमित्यतस्मिन्नर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् already ordained (IV. 1. 83) comes after the name of a colour in the sense of \"colored thereby\".

The verb रञ्ज् means to change white into another color. That by which a thing is coloured is called रागः 'color'. तेन 'by which', i.e. after a word in the instrumental case in construction, being the name of a particular colour. Thus कषायेण रक्तं वस्त्रं = काषायम् 'a cloth coloured of a dull red'. So also मांजिष्ठम्, कौसुम्भम् ॥

Why do we say रागात् "after the name of a color"? Observe देवदत्तेन रक्तं वस्त्रम्, here the affix अण् will not come after the word '_Devadattena_', for though it is in construction in the instrumental case, yet it is not the name of a colour.

In the sentence "काषायौ गर्दभस्य कर्णौ, हारिद्रौ कुक्कटस्यादौ" the words काषाय and हारिद्र are used metaphorically.

From this _sutra_ up to (IV. 2. 12) inclusive, the affixes are to be added to the word which is in the instrumental case in construction in a sentence (IV. 1. 82): as in the last chapter, the affixes were added to a word in the genitive case.
