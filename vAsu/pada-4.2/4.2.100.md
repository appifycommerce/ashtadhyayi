As राङ्कवो गौः or राङ्कवायणो गौः but राङ्कवको मनुष्यः (IV. 2. 134).

Q. The word रंकु belongs to कच्छादि class (IV. 2. 133); and when a human being is to be denoted, then by (IV. 2. 134), it will take the affix अण्, and when a non-human being is to be designated, then it will take अण् by rule (IV. 2. 133); then where is the necessity of the present _sutra_ by which अण् is enjoined when a non-human being is to be designated ? To this the reply is that the force of the negative affix in _amanuysha_ is that of इव; i.e. अमनुष्य = मनुष्य सदृशः "a being like man, but not man". The word अमनुष्य does not mean 'anything which is not a man'. For had this been its meaning, then a blanket is also a thing which is not a man, and in denoting a blanket, we should add ष्फक्; but we never do so. When blanket is to be denoted we add अण् of (IV. 2. 133), as राङ्कवः "a woolen blanket". When we want to denote a living being other than man, then we add अण् and ष्फक् of this _sutra_. The अण् is repeated in this _sutra_, for the purpose also of showing that otherwise अण् would have been debarred by the special affix ष्फक् ॥ 

The word रंकु is the name of a country, it would have taken अण् under the universal rule (IV. 1. 83), but this is debarred by वुञ् of (IV. 2. 125), and वुञ् is debarred by ठञ् of (IV. 2. 119), and ठञ् is debarred by अण् of (IV. 2. 132), as it has क् as penultimate, the present _sutra_ debars that and ordains अण् and ष्फक् ॥
