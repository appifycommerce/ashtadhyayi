sutra: इञश्च
vRtti: गोत्रे य इञ् विहितस्तदन्तात्प्रातिपदिकादण्प्रत्ययो भवति शैषिकः ॥
vRtti_eng: After a Family-name formed by इञ्, the affix अण् is added in the remaining senses.

---
This debars अण् ॥ Thus from दक्ष we have Patronymic दाक्षि, from which दाक्षाः "the pupils of _Dakshi_" ; प्लाक्षाः, माहकाः ॥ The final इ is elided before अण् by (6.4.148).

Why do we say 'denoting a family-name'? Observe सौतङ्गमिः, a word formed by इञ् of (4.2.80), not denoting a family, but having the four-fold sense of (4.2.68) - (4.2.70). The further derivative from this will be सौतङ्गमीयम् by छ (4.2.114).
