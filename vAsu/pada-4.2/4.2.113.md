sutra: न द्व्यचः प्राच्यभरतेषु
vRtti: द्व्यचः प्रातिपदिकात्प्राच्यभरतगोत्रादिञन्तादण् प्रत्ययो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix अण् is not however added to a word which, though ending in the Patronymnic affix इञ्, consists of two syllables, when it is the family name of Eastern people or of _Bharata_."
---
This _sutra_ debars अण् which would have come by the last _sutra_. The result being, that the words answering to the description given in this aphorism, form the शैषिक derivatives by the affix छ (IV. 2. 114). Thus पौष्कीयाः, काशीयाः from पौष्कि, काशि ॥ Why do we say "consisting of two syllables"? Observe पान्नागाराः formed by अण् from पान्नागारि ॥

Why do we say "when it denotes the family-names of East folks or _Bharata_"? Observe: दाक्षाः from दाक्षि ॥

Q. How do you form काशीय when by rule (IV. 2. 116), the proper form would be काशिकी or काशिका ?

Ans. The word काशि of _sutra_ 116 refers to a country because it occurs with चेदि, while the काशि of the example under the present aphorism is a Family-name.
 
The _Bharatas_ belong also to the East-Folk or _Prachyas_. Their separate mention here indicates by _Jhapaka_ or inference, that whereever _Prachya_ is used in these _sutras_, it does not include the _Bharatas_. See (II 4. 66).
