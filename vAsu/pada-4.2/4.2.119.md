sutra: ओर्देशे ठञ्
vRtti: उवर्णान्ताद् देशवाचिनः प्रातिपदिकात् ठञ् प्रत्ययो भवति शैषिकः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix ठञ्, comes in the remaining senses, after a Nominal-stem denoting a locality and ending in उ ॥"

The phrase 'वृद्धात्' does not govern this _sutra_. For had it been understood in this aphorism, there would have been no necessity of repeating it in the next.

Thus तैषादकर्षुकः, शाबरजम्बुकः ॥ Why do we say देशे 'denoting a country'? Observe पाटवाः 'the pupils of पटु' formed by अण् ॥

In the previous _sutras_, the _anuvritti_ of ठञ् and ञिठ् both were current; hence the repetition of ठञ् in this _sutra_, because we could not take the _anuvritti_ of ठञ् from the last _sutra_ without drawing the _anuvritti_ of ञिठ् ॥
