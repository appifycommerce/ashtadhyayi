sutra: विभाषा कुरुयुगन्धराभ्याम्
vRtti: कुरु युगन्धर इत्येताभ्यां विभाषा वुञ् प्रत्ययो भवति शैषिकः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix वुञ् comes optionally in the remaining senses, after the words '_Kuru_', and '_Yugandhara_'."

Thus कौरवकः or कौरवः꣡, यौगन्धरकः or गौगन्धरः꣡ ॥ These words denote जनपद or inhabited countries, and therefore by _sutra_ (IV. 2. 125) they would always, have taken the affix वुञ्. The present _sutra_ makes the application of वुञ् optional and not obligatory. The word कुरु occurs in the list of कच्छादि class (IV. 2. 133). By virtue of its being so classified, it will take अण् also. And when it means man or something found in men, it will take necessarily, not optionally, the affix वुञ् by virtue of _sutra_ (IV. 2. 134). As कौरवको मनुष्यः, कौरवकमस्य हसितम् ॥ This aphorism therefore, teaches option regarding कुरु with these restrictions, while it teaches option absolutely with regard to the word युगन्धरः ॥
