sutra: घञः सास्यां क्रियेति ञः
vRtti: घञन्तात्क्रियावाचिनः प्रथमासमर्थादस्यामिति सप्तम्यर्थे स्त्रीलिङ्गे ञः प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix ञ, added to a noun of action ending in the affix घञ्, denotes an action occurring in that."

These words are also feminine. The meaning of the words of the aphorism is:- घञः "after a word ending in the affix घञ्"; सा 'that', अस्यां 'in it', the feminine gender shows that the word is also feminine. क्रिया "action"; this qualifies the sense of the affix. To put it in other words, the _sutra_ means "After a word ending in घञ्, expressing an action, being in the Ist case in construction, the affix ञ is added in the sense of a 7th case-affix, the resultant word being in the feminine gender".

Thus श्येनपातोऽस्यां वर्तते - श्यैनंपाता, so also तैलंपाता ॥ The nasal is added by (VI. 3. 71). Thus श्यैनंपाता मृगया 'a chase with hawks to bring down or fell the prey'. तैलंपाता स्वधा "an oblation to the ancestors in which sesamum is thrown".

The repetition of सास्यां in this _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ could have been obtained from the last _sutra_, indicates that this is a general rule, and not one confined to "games" only. Thus दण्डपातोऽस्यां तिथौवर्तते = दाण्डपाता तिथिः; मौसलपाता तिथिः ॥
