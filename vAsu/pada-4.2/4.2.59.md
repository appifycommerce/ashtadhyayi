sutra: तदधीते तद्वेद
vRtti: तदिति द्वितीयासमर्थादधीते वेद इत्येतयोरर्थ योर्यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् (1V. 1. 83) comes after a word denoting 'some subject of study', in the sense of 'who has studied that or who understands that'.

In others words, the _sutra_ means that the affix is added to a word in the accusative case in construction, denoting a person who studies or knows, that. As छन्दोऽधीते = छान्दसः 'who studies Prosody'. वैयाकरणः (VII.3.3) 'who knows grammar'. So also नैरुक्तः, नैमित्तः 'who knows the causes'. भौहूर्त्तः, औत्पातः ॥ The word तद् is repeated in this _sutra_, in order to show a distinction between one who studies and who understands.
