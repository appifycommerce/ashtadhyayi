sutra: प्रोक्ताल्लुक्
vRtti: प्रोक्तप्रत्ययान्तादध्येतृवेदित्रोरुत्पन्नस्य लुग्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the title of a work, which is named after the Announcer thereof, the affixes denoting 'who studies or who knows that' are elided by _luk_'.

This _sutra_ may be rendered in the following way also :- "There is लुक् of these affixes after a word ending with an affix denoting announcer". The affixes denoting प्रोक्त or the first propounder are taught in (IV.3.101) &c. Thus पाणिनिना प्रोक्तम् = पाणिनीयम् 'the system of Grammar enounced by _Panini_', पाणिनीयमधीते = पाणिनीयः, so also आपिशलः ॥ The difference between the word पाणिनयि meaning the system of Grammar, and पाणिनीय formed with अण्, meaning who studies that Grammar, would consist in the accent, and the formation of the feminine. As पाणिनीया ब्राह्मणी ॥ For had there been no elision expressly enjoined by this _sutra_, in forming the feminine, ङीप् would be required by (IV.1.15), as the word would end in अण्; and the accent of the word would be finally acute (अण् being acute by the universal rule of affix-accent (III.1.3)). But when the affix is elided, the feminine is formed by टाप्, the accent is on the middle, owing to the छ affix. (_Phit_ _Su_ II. 19).
