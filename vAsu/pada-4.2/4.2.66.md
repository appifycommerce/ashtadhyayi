sutra: छन्दोब्राह्मणानि च तद्विषयाणि
vRtti: प्रोक्तग्रहणमनुवर्तते । छन्दांसि ब्राह्मणानि च प्रोक्तप्रत्ययान्तानि तद्विषयाण्येव भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affixes denoting the announcer, when added to _Chhandas_ and the _Brahmanas_, express this relation only."
---
The word प्रोक्त is to be read into this _sutra_. The force of the affixes denoting announcer (IV. 3. 101), when used after a word denoting a Vedic Text or a _Brahmana_, is that of expressing "one who studies" or "one who knows". तद्विषयाणि means "this relation", i.e. the subject treated of in this section, namely, the relation of अध्येतृ or वेदितृ ॥ In other words, the affixes, which ordinarily denote 'announcer', have the force of "one who studies or one who knows" when added to _Veda_-Text or _Brahmanas_. That is, a प्रोक्त affix should not be added to a _Veda_ or a _Brahmana_, except when an अध्येतृ or वेदितृ affix follows it, and as such latter affixes are always elided by (IV. 2. 94), it follows that a प्रोक्त affix when added to a _Veda_ or a _Brahmana_, means "he who studies or knows the _Veda_ anounced by". In fact there is no affix which can denote merely the announcer of a _Veda_, perhaps because the Vedas are eternal and no one can be its announcer only, but must be one who has studied it and known it, in order to qualify him to promulgate it.

Thus from the word कठ, the name of a _Veda_-Text, we get कठाः meaning 'those who study or know _Katha_ Veda'. The word is thus formed. To the word कठ we add the affix णिनि denoting announcer, by (IV. 3. 104) : then we elide it by (IV. 3. 107), leaving the bare word कट, then we add अण्, which again we elide by (IV. 2. 64). कठ + णिनि = कट + o (IV. 3. 107); कठ + अण् = कठ (IV. 2. 64) Plural कठाः "those who study the _Veda_ announced by _Katha_".

Other examples to illustrate this _sutra_ are: मौदाः (IV. 3. 101) 'who study the _Veda_ announced by _Muda_'. पैप्पलादः, आर्चाभिनः (IV. 3. 104) वाजसनेयिनः (IV. 3. 106) "who study the _Veda_ announced by _Pippalada_, _Richava_, or _Vajasaneya_". Similarly with words denoting a _Brahmana_-Text. Thus : ताण्डिनः (IV. 3. 104), भाल्लविनः (IV. 3. 105), शाट्यायनिनः (IV. 3. 105) ऐतरेयिणः (IV. 3. 105) "who study the _Brahmanas_ announced by _Tandya_, _Bhallava_, _Satyayana_, or _Aitareya_". 

Why is the word _Brahmana_ which is also _Chhandas_, used separately in this _sutra_? In order to include only a certain limited number of _Brahmana_ Texts to the benefits of this rule, and not all. Thus it will not apply to the _Brahmana_ announced by _Yajnyavalkya_. Thus याज्ञवल्क्येन प्रोक्तानि ब्राह्मणानि = याज्ञवल्क्यानि ॥ Similarly सौलभानि ॥ These _Brahmanas_ being of recent origin, the presumption of eternity does not apply to them, See (IV. 3. 105).

The word च meaning "and" is employed in the _sutra_. It has the force of applying this rule to some other cases not specially mentioned in the _sutra_. Thus it will apply to some _Kalpa_ Texts and _Sutra_ Texts also. Thus काश्यपिनः, कौशिकिनः "who study or know the _Kalpa_ texts announced by _Kasyapa_ or _Kusika_" so also _sutra_ : as, "the पाराशरिणो भिक्षवः "the _Bhikshus_ who study the _Sutras_ promulgated by _Parasara_". शैलालिनो नटाः, कर्मन्दिनः, कृशश्विनः &c.

Why do we say "_Chhandas_ and _Brahmanas_"? Because the प्रोक्त affix after any other word will have its own significance, pure and simple; as, पाणिनीयं व्याकरणम् ॥ पैङ्गीकल्पः ॥
