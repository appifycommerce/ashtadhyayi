sutra: उदक् च विपाशः
vRtti: विपाश उत्तरे कूले ये कूपात्तेष्वभिधेयेष्वञ् प्रत्ययो भवति चातुरर्थिकः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix अञ् comes in the quadruple sense, after any Nominal stem in denoting 'a well' situated on the northern bank of the river _Vipasa_."

This debars अण्; and it applies to all words whether polysyllabic or not. Thus दात्तः "a well completed by _Datta_", गौप्तः &c.

Why do we say on the "northern bank"? Because if a well is situate on the southern bank of the river _Vipasa_, then the affix अण् will apply as दात्तः and गौप्तः, the difference being in the accent. This _sutra_ illustrates the refined distinctions drawn by the author, and the importance attached to accents in former times.
