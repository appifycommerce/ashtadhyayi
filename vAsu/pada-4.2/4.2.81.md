sutra: जनपदे लुप्
vRtti: देशे तन्नाम्नीति यश्चातुरर्थिकः प्रत्ययो भवति, तस्य देशविशेषे जनपदेऽभिधेये लुब्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The name of a kingdom is formed by the _lup_ elision of these affixes, (when the name of the people without the change of number and gender, is at the same time the name of the kingdom).

The words within bracket in the above _sutra_ are added by the reading together of this _sutra_ with _sutra_ (1.2.51). Dr. Otto Bohtlingk the learned translator of _Panini_ in German, has done so, and I think this addition is necessary for the elucidation of the _sutra_. The aphorism literally means : (The quadruply significant affix) is elided, when the place (देश) to be named is a kingdom (जनपद). Thus पंचालानां निवासो जनपदः = पंचालाः । So also कुरवः, मत्स्याः, अङ्गाः, वङ्गाः, मगधाः, सुह्माः, पुण्ड्राः ॥

Why is there no _lup_-elision of the affix in the following examples : औदुम्बरो जनपदः 'the Kingdom in which there are fig-trees'. वैदिशो जनपदः &c? Because here the words औदुम्बरः and वैदिशः are not names of Kingdom, but are used merely as epithets. In fact the phrase तन्नाम्नि is understood here also.
