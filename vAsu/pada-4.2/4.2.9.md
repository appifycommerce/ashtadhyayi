_Karika_
सिद्धे यस्येतिलोपेन किमर्थं ययतौ डितौ ।
ग्रहणं माऽतदर्थे भूद्वामदेव्यस्य नञ्स्वरे ॥

This debars अण् ॥ Thus वामदेवेन दृष्टं साम = वामदेव्यं॑ or वामदेव्यं꣡ ॥ The indicatory त् in 'dyat' shows that य has _svarita_ accent (VI. 1. 125).

Q. What is the use of the indicatory ड्?

Ans. The final syllable is elided when a डित् affix is added, by (VI. 4. 143).

Q. The final अ of वामदेव would have been elided without making this affix डित्, by the rule (VI. 4. 148), then what is the use of making this affix डित्?

Ans. Well, the author here indicates by _jnapaka_, the existence of these two maxims of interpretation, viz. _Paribhashas_ निरनुबन्धकग्रहणे न सानुबन्धकस्य "when a term void of _anubandhas_ is employed, it does not denote that which has an _anubandha_ attached to it". तदनुबन्धकग्रहणे नातदनुबन्धकस्य "when a term with one or more _anubandhas_ is employed it does not denote that which, in addition to those, has another _anubandha_ attached to it".

For had य and यत् been only taught instead of '_dya_' and '_dyat_', then by rule (VI. 2. 156) the final of such word, with the negative particle अ, would take _udatta_ on the final, but that is not the case. Therefore अवामदेव्यं is not finally acute, but has acute on the first syllable, taking the accent of the Indeclinable (VI. 2. 2). As अ꣡वामदेव्यं ॥
