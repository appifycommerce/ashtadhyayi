sutra: राष्ट्रावारपाराद् घखौ
vRtti: राष्ट्र अवारपार इत्येताभ्यां यथासंख्यं घखावित्येतौ प्रत्ययौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes _gha_ and _kha_ are respectively added after the words राष्ट्र and अवारपार ॥

---
The affix इय substituted for घ, and ईन for ख (VII.1.2). Thus राष्ट्रियः 'born &c. in a country', अवारपारीणः 'who or what goes or extends to both banks'.

Vart:- The affix ख comes also when the words अवार and पार are taken separately; as well as when compounded inversely: e.g. अवारीणः 'belonging to this bank of the river', पारीणः 'belonging to the other bank', पारावारीणः 'belonging to the other bank as well as to this'. Here as well as in several of the subsequent aphorisms, merely the stems and their appropriate affixes are given; the sense of these affixes are those of 'being born' &c. to be taught hereafter in (IV.3.25) and _sutras_ that follow it.

"There shall now be mentioned derivatives which end with those affixes the first whereof is घ, and the last where of are ट्यु (IV.3.24), with specification of the original term to which the application of those affixes is appropriate; and their varieties of meaning, such as 'being produced therefrom' (IV.2.25), and the like, shall be mentioned; and the declensional cases in connection with which the affixes are appropriately applicable".
