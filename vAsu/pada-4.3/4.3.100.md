sutra: जनपदिनां जनपदवत्सर्वे जनपदेन समानशब्दानां बहुवचने
vRtti: जनपदिनो ये बहुवचने जनपदेन समानशब्दास्तेषां जनपदवत्सर्वं भवति प्रत्ययः प्रकृतिश्च सोस्य भक्तिरित्येतस्मिन्विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: Of words denoting Princes (lit. who are lords of _janapada_) the base and affix meaning 'this is his object of veneration' are the same, in every respect, like those of a word denoting kingdom, provided that, the Prince-denoting words have, in the plural, the same form, as the kingdom-denoting words.

The words of this _sutra_ require a detailed analysis. जनपदिनाम् gen. plural of जनपदिन् meaning 'Iord of an inhabited country' i. e. _Kshatriya_ Princes, बहुवचने 'in the plural', जनपदेन समान शब्दानां 'the same form as the _jana_- _pada_ denoting word', जनपदवत् सर्वम् 'every thing is like _jana_-_pada_'. In other words, 'after those bases denoting _Kshatriya_ Princes which in the plural have the same forms as the names of the countries, the affix in the sense of veneration will be the same as will come after a _janapada word_.' Now the affixes denoting  भक्ति as regards जनपद words are given in _Sutras_ (IV.2.124) &c. and those affixes will apply here. Thus अङ्गा जनपदो भक्तिरस्य = आङ्गकः formed by वुञ् of _Sutra_ (IV.2.125), meaning 'who loves the country of _Angas_' Similarly वाङ्गकः, सौह्मकः पौन्द्रकः ॥

Similarly अङ्गाः क्षत्रिया भक्तिरस्य = आङ्गकः formed by the same affix वुञ्, with this difference of meaning 'who loves the _Kshatriyas_ called _Angas_'. So वाङ्गकः, सौह्मकः &c.

Why do we say 'of _Kshatriya_ Princes'; (_janapadinam_). Observe, पंचाला ब्राह्मणा भक्तिरस्य = पांचालाः ॥ Here the general affix अण् is employed.

The word सर्व is used in the _sutra_ to show that not only the affixes are the same, but the bases to which the affixes are added will be the same. In the plural, the _Kshatriya_ and the _Janapada_ bases have the same form, but in the singular and dual, the forms of _Kshatriya_-bases are different. Thus मद्रस्यापत्यं = sing. माद्रः (IV.1.170) dual, माद्रौ pl. मद्राः. The form मद्राः denotes both 'the Kings or _Kshatriyas_ of _Madras_' as well as 'the country called _Madras_'. Thus मद्रो भक्तिरस्य = मद्रकः ॥ So also in the singular and dual, मद्राः will be the base to which the affix will be added. Thus माद्रो भक्तिरस्य माद्रौ वा भक्तिरस्य = मद्रकः ॥ Similarly वार्ज्य (from वृजि (IV.1.171)), as वार्ज्यो वा भक्तिरस्य वार्ज्यौ वा भक्तिरस्य = वृजिकः ॥

Why do we say जनपदेन समान शब्दानाम् 'the word having the same sound as the _janapada_ word'? Thus अनुषण्डो जनपदः, पौरवो राजा स भक्तिरस्य = पौरवीयः ॥ Here _Paurava_ and _Anushanda_ have not the same sound.

The word बहुवचने is used in the _sutra_, to indicate, that, though the समान शब्दता or 'the similarity of word-form', occurs in the plural number only, yet this _atidesa_ rule applies to the same words in the singular and dual also. For in the plural, the form will be same, because there the _Tadraja_ affix is elided; but in the singular and dual, the _Tadraja_ affix is not elided, and therefore, the word denoting a principality and the word denoting a prince will not have the same form; but this rule applies there also. As वाङ्गः or वाङ्गौ भक्तिरस्य वाङ्गकः ॥
