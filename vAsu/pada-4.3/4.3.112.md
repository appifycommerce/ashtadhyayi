sutra: तेनैकदिक्
vRtti: तेनेति तृतीयासमर्थादेकदिगित्येतस्मिन्नर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: An affix ((IV. 1. 83) &c) comes after a word in the third case in construction, in the sense of 'in the same direction with that.'

---
The word एक दिक means तुल्य दिक i.e. a common direction. Thus सुदाम्ना एकदिक = सौदामनी विद्युत् "a lightening, literally that which is in the same direction as the hill called the _Sudaman_." So हैमवती, त्त्रैककुदी, पैलुमूली ॥

The repetition of तेन, though it could have been supplied by _anuvritti_ from (IV.3.101), is for the sake of indicating that the _anuvritti_ of the छन्दस् which regulated all the preceding ten _sutras_, does not extend to this aphorism, and therefore the तद्विषयता of (IV.2.66) which was applied in those _sutras_ does not apply here.
