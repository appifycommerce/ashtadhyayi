Knowledge acquired by oneself without being taught is called उपज्ञातं, i.e. an intuition or self taught knowledge. Thus पाणिनिनोपज्ञातं = पाणिनीयम् अकालकं व्याकरणं 'the law of Grammar discovered by _Panini_'. So also काशकृत्स्नम् गुरुलाघवम्, आपिशलम् दुष्करणम् ॥ Compare (II. 4. 21). The _Panini_'s Grammar is called अकालकं as it does not define काल or tenses; गुरुलाघव is the name of the sciences of wealth (यत्रोपायाणां गौरवं लाघवं चिन्त्यते) ॥ The word _Duskarana_ is the name of a Grammar, so-called because of the technical term दुषू occurring in it. Some say it means कामशास्त्रः ॥
