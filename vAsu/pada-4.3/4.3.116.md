sutra: कृते ग्रन्थे
vRtti: तेनेत्येव तृतीयासमर्थात्कृतइत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति, यत्तत्कृतं मन्यश्चेत्स भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "An affix comes after a word in the 3rd case in construction, in the sense of 'made', the thing made being 'a book',"

Thus वररुचिना कृताः = वाररुचाः श्लोकाः 'the verses composed by _Vararuchi_'. So also हैकुपादो ग्रन्थः, भैकुराटो ग्रन्थः, जालूकः ॥

Why do we say 'a book'? Observe तक्षकृतः प्रासादः 'the palace made by _Taksha_'.

That which one originates is called कृतः and is therefore an 'art', while knowledge of laws &c. that already exist, but are discovered for the first time by some one, is called उपज्ञातं ॥
