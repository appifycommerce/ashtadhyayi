sutra: संघाङ्कलक्षणेष्वञ्यञिञामण्
vRtti: संघादिषु प्रत्ययार्थविशेषणेष्वञन्ताद् यञन्ताद् इञन्ताच्च प्रातिपदिकादण् प्रत्ययो भवति तस्येदमित्येतस्मिन् विषये । पूर्वस्य वुञो ऽपवादः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् comes in the sense of 'this is his', after a Patronymic word ending with the affix अञ्, यञ् or इञ्, the words so formed expressing a multitude, a mark or a sign.

The word संघ means 'congregation'. The word लक्षण and अङ्क should be distinguished. लक्षण means a mark which is the property of that person and forms a distinguishing feature of that person, as विद्या 'learning' is a लक्षण of the clan of _Bidas_, the _Bidas_ being famous for learning. The word अङ्क is a mark which shows that the thing so marked is the property of another : as a mark on a cow showing to what person or clan that cow belongs. The अङ्क though occurring in a person or thing does not belong to that person or thing, as the mark of a cow does not belong to the cow, but the लक्षण is a mark which belongs to the person or thing wherein it is found.

This _sutra_ debars वुञ् of the last aphorism.

Vart :- The word घोष 'a cow-pen', should also be read along with संघ &c. Thus the words so formed denote four things (1) congregation, (2) mark (3) sign (4) a hamlet or cowpen. This being so, the rule of mutual correspondence according to order of enumeration (I.3.10) does not apply.

Thus अञन्तात् (IV.1.104) -- बैदः 'a congregation, or mark or sign or a hamlet of the _Bidas_'. यञन्तात् (IV.1.105) – गार्ग्य + अण् = गार्गः (VI.4.148), (VI.4.151) "a congregation, or a mark, or a sign or a hamlet belonging to the _Gargyas_ ?" इञन्तात् (IV.1.95) – दाक्षि + अण् = दाक्षः (VI.4.148) 'a congregation &c of the _Dakshis_'.

The ण् of अण् could not serve the purpose of _Vriddhi_ here, for all the words to which this affix is added, have _Vriddhi_ by virtue of the affixes अञ्, यञ् or इञ् in which they end. The अ would have served the purpose as well, so far as _Vriddhi_ is concerned, but अण् is used to show that the feminine is formed by ङीप् (IV.1.15), Thus बैदी ॥ It further prevents पुंवद्भाव in compounds (VI.3.39), as, बैदी विद्याऽस्य = बैदीविद्यः i.e. बिदानामसाधारणी या विद्या सा यस्यास्ति स ॥
