sutra: न दण्डमाणवान्तेवासिषु
vRtti: दण्डप्रधाना माणवा दण्डमाणवाः, अन्तेवासिनः शिष्या, स्तेष्वभिधेयेषु वुञ् प्रत्ययो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix वुञ् is not used after a Family-name, when it denotes a \"beginner pupil\", and \"a boarder pupil.'

The word दण्डमाणवाः means a little naughty boy (माणव), the only means of instilling knowledge in whom is the rod (खण्ड), or whose principal sign of studentship is the '_danda_' and nothing intrinsic. i.e. a mere beginner. The न is changed to ण in माणव by (IV. 1. 161) _karika_. अन्तेवासिनः are pupils or boarders who live in their teacher's house. The word '_gotra_' is understood here. Thus दाक्षाः 'the junior or the senior pupils of _Dakshi_.' माहकाः ॥ So also गौकक्षा दण्डमाणवा अन्तेवासिनोवा ॥
