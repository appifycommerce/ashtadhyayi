sutra: तस्य विकारः
vRtti: तस्येति षष्ठीसमर्थाद्विकार इत्येतस्मिन्विषये यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: An affix ((IV. 1. 83) &c) comes after a word in the sixth case in construction, in the sense of 'a modification thereof'.

---
The word विकार means the change of condition of the original. The word तस्य, though its _anuvritti_ could have been supplied from the previous _sutras_, has been repeated here, in order to show that the governing force of शेषे (IV.2.92) does not extend further. The affixes taught, therefore, under शेषे ((IV.2.92) &c), such as घ, ख &c. have not the sense of तस्य विकार ॥

No affix has been taught here in this _sutra_: the general affix अण् (IV.1.83) therefore will come in this sense, as well as the affixes to be taught hereafter. To give an example under this _sutra_, we must take such a word which is not governed or provided for, by the subsequent _sutras_. That is the word must not denote a living animal for to it अञ् (IV.3.154) applies; it must have _udatta_ on the first syllable, for an _anudattadi_ will have अञ् (IV.3.140); it must not have a _Vriddhi_ vowel आ, ऐ, or औ in the first syllable, to which मयट् (IV.3.144) applies; and it must not be a word specifically mentioned in any one of the following aphorisms. Thus it applies to the words अश्मन् and भस्मन् formed by मनिन् (_Un_IV. 146,145) and to मृतिका formed by तिकन् (V.4.39) which are _adyudatta_ owing to नित् accent. Thus अश्मनो विकारः = आश्मनः ॥ The टि is sometimes elided. ((VI.4.144) _Vart_) As आश्मः ॥ So also भास्मनः and मार्तिकः ॥
