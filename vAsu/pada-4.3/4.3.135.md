sutra: अवयवे च प्राण्योषधिवृक्षेभ्यः
vRtti: प्राण्योषधिवृक्षवाचिभ्यः शब्देभ्यः षष्ठीसमर्थेभ्यो ऽवयवे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति चकाराद्विकारे च ॥
vRtti_eng: An affix comes after a word denoting an animal, a herb and a tree, in sixth case in construction, in the sense of 'this is its part', (as well as 'this is its modification').

By the word च in the _sutra_, the phrase तस्य विकारः is also read into the _sutra_.

Thus कपोतस्य विकारोऽवयवो वा = कापोतः (IV.3.154) ॥ So also मायूरः, तैत्तिरः 'a modification, product or part of a peacock &c -- viz a fan &c.' So also ओषधिः as, मौर्वम् 'product of _Murva_ i.e. ashes or the stalk of _Murva_'. So also वृक्ष, as, कारीरं meaning "the stalk or the ashes of _Karira_ tree".

In the subsequent _sutras_, both the words विकार and अवयव have governing force. But after words which denote non-animals, non-plants or non-trees, the affixes have only the sense of विकार ॥ This is a rather unique case of double _anuvritti_, not co-extensive in every respect.
