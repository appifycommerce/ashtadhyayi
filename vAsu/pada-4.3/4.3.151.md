Thus मौञ्जं शिक्यम् from मुञ्ज by अण् ॥ गार्मुतं चक्रम्, वार्ध्री बालप्रग्रथिता भवति; बैल्वो ब्रह्मवर्चसकामेन कार्यः ॥

The word उत्वत् means 'having उत् or short u (I.1.70)' The rule does not apply to words containing long ऊ, as भूममयान्यभ्राणि ॥ The वत् in उत्वत् shows that the rule applies not only to words ending in उ, but also to words having उ. Had वत् not been used, the _tadanta_-_vidhi_ would require the application of the rule to words ending in उ, but not to those which had उ in any other part of their form. So that the prohibition applies to वेणु also, as वैणवी यष्टिः (IV.3.136).

The word मुञ्ज is _ady_-_udatta_ by तृणधान्यानां (_Phit_ II. 4): and therefore it takes the universal अण् (IV.3.134). The word गर्मुत् is formed by the affix उत् plus the augment मुट् (मृग्रोरुतिः, ग्रोमुट्च _Un_ I. 94 and 95), and is finally acute, and therefore it takes अञ् by (IV.3.140), and forms गार्मुत ॥ This word has acute on the final also, as तस्या एतं गार्मुतं चरुं निर्वयेत् ॥ The word वर्ध्र is _ady_-_udatta_ by _Phit_ II. 19. And therefore takes अण्, the feminine being formed by ङीप् (IV.1.15).
