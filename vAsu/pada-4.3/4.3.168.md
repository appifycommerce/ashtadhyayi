sutra: कंसीयपरशव्ययोर्यञञौ लुक् च
vRtti: प्राक्क्रीताच्छेन कंसीयः । उगवादिभ्यो यत् । परशव्यः । कंसीयपरशव्यशब्दाभ्यां यथासंख्यं यञञौ प्रत्ययौ भवतस्तस्य विकार इत्येतस्मिन्विषय, तत्संनियोगेन च कंसीयपरशव्ययोर्लुग् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes यञ्, and अञ् come respectively in the sense of \"its product\", after the words \"_kansiya_\" and \"_parasavya_\", and there is _luk_-elision (of the छ and यत् affixes of those words).
---
The word कंसीयः is formed by छ (V. 1. 1), and परशव्य is formed by adding यत् (V. 1. 2). These affixes छ and यत् are elided when the affixes यञ् and अञ् are added. Thus कंसीय + यञ् = कंस + यञ् = कांस्यः so also पारशव from परशव्य thus परशव्य + अञ् = परशु + अञ् = पारशवः ॥

The words लुक् च mean 'there shall be elision'. Of what? Certainly not of the primitive, for लुक् is never applied to the elision of a base, but of an affix only (I. 1. 61). It follows therefore that the elision is of the affixes of कंसीय and परशव्य ॥ Now these words have two affixes, thus. To the root कम् is added first the _Unadi_ affix स (_Un_ III. 62) and we get कंस; next to कंस is added छ. So also to पर + शृ is added the affix उ (_Un_ I. 33) and we have परशु, to which is then added यत् and we have परशव्य ॥ The question arises, should these affixes स and उ be also elided. The answer is 'no'. The word प्रातिपदिकात् of (IV. 1. 1) is understood is this _sutra_; so the elision will take place of those affixes only which follow a _pratipadika_. But स and उ are added to a _Dhatu_ and not a _pratipadika_, hence those affixes are saved from the operation of लुक् ॥

The word परशव्य being gravely accented on the first (VI. 1. 185) would have taken अञ् by (IV. 3. 140). The present _sutra_ teaches the elision only of its affix यत्, अञ् being already obtained.

Q. The final अ of कंसीय and परशव्य will be elided by (VI. 4. 148) before these _taddhita_ affixes, and after such elision, the final य् will be elided by (VI. 4. 150), where is then the necessity of this _sutra_?

A. The final य् will not be elided, because (VI. 4. 150) will apply only then, when an affix beginning with long ई follows, which is not the case here.
