sutra: अमावास्याया वा
vRtti: अमावास्याशब्दाद्वुन् प्रत्ययो भवति वा तत्र जात इत्येतस्मिन्विषये ॥

This debars अण् of (IV. 3. 16). Thus अमावास्यकः or आमावास्यः ॥ This affix वुन् is applied to the word अमावस्य also, on the maxim एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वात् "That which has undergone a change in regard to one of its parts, is by no means in consequence of this change, something else than what it was before the change had taken place". Thus अमावस्यकः or आमावस्यः ॥
