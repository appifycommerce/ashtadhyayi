sutra: संभूते
vRtti: सप्तमीसमर्थान् ङ्याप्प्रातिपदिकात् संभूतइत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a nominal-stem or a word ending in the feminine affix ङी and आप्, being in the 7th case in construction, an affix comes in the sense of 'adapted therein.'

Except the word 'adapted' which is the meaning of the word संभूत, all the other words of the _sutra_ have been supplied from the previous aphorisms. The word संभूत does not mean in this _sutra_ 'origin' or 'existence', for the word जात and भव already express that notion. It here means 'suitableness' 'adequacy' i.e. अवक्लृप्तिः and प्रमाणातिरेकः ॥

Thus स्रुघ्ने संभवति = सौघ्नः 'what is suited to the country of _Srughna_.' So also माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥ The word तत्र is understood here also.
