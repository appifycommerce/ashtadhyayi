sutra: उप्ते च
vRtti: कालादिति च । सप्तमीसमर्थात्कालवाचिनः प्रातिपदिकादुप्ते यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "An affix comes after a word denoting time, being in the 7th case in construction, meaning 'sown therein'."

Thus हेमन्ते उप्यन्ते = हैमन्ता यवाः 'the barley sown in autumn.' ग्रैष्मा व्रीहयः ॥

The separation of this _sutra_ from the last, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_ in which the _anuvritti_ of उप्त only goes, which could not have been the case had this word been included in the last _sutra_.
