sutra: हेतुमनुष्येभ्योऽन्यतरस्यां रूप्यः
vRtti: हेतुभ्यो मनुष्येभ्यश्चान्यतरस्यां रूप्यः प्रत्ययो भवति तत आगत इत्येतस्मिन्विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix रूप्य denotes that which from something has originated, when it is added to a word denoting 'cause,' or to the name of a man viewed as a cause."

The word मनुष्य is used meaning 'men as causes.' हेतु means cause or instrument. Thus समादागतं = समरूप्यम् or समीयम् by छ of (IV. 2. 138) meaning 'what proceeds from a like cause.' So also विषमरूप्यम् or विषमीयम् ॥ So of men also देवदत्तरूप्यम् or दैवदत्तम् (IV. 1. 83) 'what originates with देवदत्तः', यज्ञदत्तरूप्यम् or यज्ञदत्तम् ॥

The word हेतुमनुष्येभ्यः is in the plural in the _sutra_, indicating that _svarupavidhi_ (I. 1. 68) does not apply here.

In denoting हेतु, there is employed the Instrumental case as taught in (II. 3. 23): and according to the _jnapaka_ in the present _sutra_, the Ablative case may also be employed in denoting a हेतु, ॥ Or the use of the ablative case in the sense of हेतु, may be explained by (II. 3. 25).
