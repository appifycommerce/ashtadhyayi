sutra: अभिनिष्क्रामति द्वारम्
vRtti: द्वितीयासमर्थादभिनिष्क्रामतीत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति यत् तदभिनिष्क्रामति द्वारं चेद् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: An affix comes, after a word in the 2nd case in construction, in the sense of 'a door which looks towards that'.
---
Thus स्रौघ्नः 'a gate which looks towards _Srughna_', -- as a gate of _Kanyakubja_. So also माथुरम्, राष्ट्रियम् ॥

Objection. The _sutra_ would have stood better as अभिनिष्क्रमणं द्वारं, for by using अभिनिष्क्रामति, you make the word द्वारं as if it was a being endowed with sense.

Ans. This objection may be answered by saying that the gate is the well-known instrument (करण) to the action of अभिनिष्क्रमण; and an instrument may be used as an agent to a verb: as साध्वसिश्छिनत्ति 'the sword cuts nicely.'

Why do we say द्वारम् "when it is a gate"? Observe स्रुघ्नमभिनिष्क्रामति पुरुषः 'a person faces towards _Srughna_'.
