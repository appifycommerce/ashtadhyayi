sutra: सोस्य निवासः
vRtti: स इति प्रथमासमर्थादस्येति षष्ठ्यर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति यत्प्रथमासमर्थे निवासश्चेत्स भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a word in the 1st case in construction, an affix comes in the sense of 'this is his dwelling place'

The word स shows that the word to which the affix is to be added is in the nominative case. अस्य 'his' shows that the meaning of the affix is that of a genitive case. निवासः, shows that the first word in construction must signify a dwelling place. निवास means "a country i. e. where a person lives (_nivasanti_ _asmin_)".

स्रुघ्नो निवासोऽस्य = स्रौघ्नः 'a present dweller of _Srughna_', माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः &c.
