sutra: अभिजनश्च
vRtti: सोस्येत्येव । स इति प्रथमासमर्थादस्येति षष्ठ्यर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति यत्प्रथमासमर्थमभिजनश्चेत्स भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After a word in the 1st case in construction, an affix comes in the sense of 'this is his mother-land'."

The difference between निवासः and अभिजनः is this. Where a person lives himself for the present, that is his निवास or dwelling-place. Where his ancestors (अभिजनाः) have lived, that is his अभिजन 'native country, home or ancestral abode'. Thus स्रौघ्नः 'a person whose ancestral home is in _Srughna_'. माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥ The separation of this _sutra_ from the last is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_, in which the _anuvritti_ of _abhijana_' only runs.
