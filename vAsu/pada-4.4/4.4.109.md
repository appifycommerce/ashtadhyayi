sutra: सोदराद्य
vRtti: सोदरशब्दात्सप्तमीसमर्थात् शयित इत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे यः प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix य comes after the word '_sodara_' in the sense of 'who sleeps,' the word being in the 7th case in construction."

By _sutra_ (VI. 3. 88) समान is optionally changed to स before the word उदर when यत् follows. Thus समानोदरे शयितः = सोर्दयः ॥ Here ओ is not _udatta_, as it was in the last; the _udatta_ here falls on य ॥
