sutra: श्वगणाट्ठञ्च
vRtti: श्वगणशब्दाट्ठञ् प्रत्ययो भवति, चकारात् ष्ठन्, चरतीत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे ठकोपवादः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix ठञ् as well as the affix ष्ठन्, comes after the word श्वगण, in the sense of 'he goes on by means there of'"

This debars ठक् ॥ Thus श्वगणेन चरति = श्वागणिकः 'who lives by dogs'. f. श्वागणिकी ॥ ठन् श्वगणिकः f. श्वगणिका ॥

The form श्वागणिकः is evolved by the breach of rule (VII. 3. 4). Thus श्वगण + ठञ् ॥ Here by (VII. 2. 117), ञ् requires _Vriddhi_ of अ of श्व ॥ But rule (VII. 3. 4) says that instead of _Vriddhi_, the letter औ comes before व in the case of श्वन् &c. The proper form, therefore, would have been शौवगणिकः ॥ The irregularity is, however, explained by saying that the prohibition contained in (VII. 3. 8) which applies when श्वन् is followed by इञ्, applies also to श्वन् followed by ठञ् ॥ In fact, the rule (VII. 3. 4) does not apply, whenever the word श्वन् is followed by an affix beginning with the letter इ ॥
