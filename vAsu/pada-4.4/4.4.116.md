sutra: अग्नाद्यत्
vRtti: अग्नशब्दाद्यत् प्रत्ययो भवति तत्र भव इत्येतस्मिन्विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: The afffx यत् comes in the _Chhandas_ in the sense of 'what stays there', after the word '_agra_',
---
Thus अग्रे भवं = अ꣡ग्र्यम् ॥ Why this separate rule for यत् would have come after अग्र by the general rule (IV. 4. 110) ? The repetition is to show that यत् is not debarred by घ and छ of the next _sutra_, which would have been the case, had this _sutra_ not existed.
