sutra: मधोर्ञ च
vRtti: मधुशब्दान्मत्वर्थे ञः प्रत्ययो भवति चकाराद्यच्च ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix ञ as well as यत् comes with the force of _matup_, in the _Chhandas_, after the word मधु ॥"

Thus माध॑वः or मधव्यः॑ ॥ Sometimes the affix is elided, as मधुः, all these mean the month of _Vaisakha_. So also माधवाः, मधव्या and मधुः meaning तनूः a body.
