sutra: संसृष्टे
vRtti: तेनेत्येव । तृतीयासमर्थात्संसृष्टइत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे ठक् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix ठक् comes, after a word in the third case in construction, when the sense is 'mixed therewith.'"

The word तेन is understood here. The word संसृष्ट means unification, mixing &c. Thus दध्ना संसृष्ट = दाधिकम् 'smeared with curds' मारिचिकम्, शार्ङ्गवेरिकम् पैप्पलिकम् ॥ The word '_sanskrtam_' (IV. 4. 3) and '_sansrshtam_' should be distinguished. The former refers to a case where by the combination of two things, a something better is produced; no such idea of bettering is to be found in संसृष्ट ॥
