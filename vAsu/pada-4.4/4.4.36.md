sutra: परिपन्थञ्च तिष्ठति
vRtti: परिपन्थशब्दात्तदिति द्वितीयासमर्थात्तिष्ठतीत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे ठक् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ठक् comes also in the sense of "who stays", after the word '_paripantham_', the word being in the second case in construction.

Thus परिपन्थं तिष्ठति = पारिपन्थिकः यः पन्थानं वर्जयित्वा तिष्ठति, यो वा पन्थानं व्याप्य तिष्ठति 'a thief' lit. "who stays at roads, a high way man". The च in the _sutra_ indicates that the sense of हन्ति 'who kills' of the last, is to be connected with this _sutra_ by the conjunction 'and'. Thus परिपन्थं हन्ति = पारिपन्थिकः ॥

The phrase 'being in the second case in construction' is understood in this _sutra_, why has then the word परिपन्थम् been shown in the second case in the _sutra_, for it is a mere superfluity? No, it shows the secular form of the word. The word परिपन्थ is synonymous with परिपन्थ, the latter, however, having other senses also.
