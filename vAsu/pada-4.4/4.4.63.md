sutra: कर्माध्ययने वृत्तम्
vRtti: तदस्येत्येव । तदिति प्रथमासमर्थादस्येति षष्ठ्यर्थे ठक् प्रत्ययो भवति यत्तत्प्रथमासमर्थं कर्म चेद्वृत्तमध्ययनविषयं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ठक् comes, in the sense of 'this is his act; occuring in study' after a word in the first case in construction, if such a word is an act (_karma_) which has occurred (_vrittam_) in study (_adhyayana_).

Thus एकमन्यदध्ययने कर्मवृत्तमस्य = ऐकान्यिकः 'a pupil who commits one (एक) error (अन्यत्) in reading', &c. literal translation being something like "one errorist". Similarly द्वैयन्यिकः त्रैयन्यिकः &c. He whose, in recitation, at the time of examination, there is the occurrence of one mistake or false reading, is called ऐकान्यिकः ॥ So who commits two mistakes is called द्वैयन्यिकः ॥ In short, in giving explanatory analysis of _taddhita_ words like ऐकान्तिकः &c, the whole phrase अध्ययने कर्मवृत्तम् must be employed.
