sutra: श्राणामांसोदनाट्टिठन्
vRtti: श्राणामांसौदनशब्दभ्यां टिठन् प्रत्ययो भवति तदस्मै दीयते नियुक्तमित्येतस्मिन्नर्थे । ठकोऽपवादः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix टिठन् comes in the sense of 'to whom this is to be given rightfully', after the words श्राणा and मांसौदन ॥

This टिठन् debars ठक् ॥ The इ of टि is for the sake of pronunciation, the ट् indicates that the feminine is formed by ङीप् (IV.1.154). Thus श्राणा नियुक्तमस्मै दीयते = श्राणिकः f. श्राणिकी 'who is entitled to get rice gruel'. So also मांसौदनिकः f. मांसौदनिकी ॥

The difference between ठक् and टिठन् is in accent, the former having _udatta_ on the final (VI.1.165), the latter on the initial (VI.1.197). The feminine of ठक् and टिठन् will both be formed by ङीप् (IV.1.15). Now the affix ठञ् resembles टिठन् both in accent (VI.1.197) and in feminine (IV.1.15). Why was not ठञ् used instead of टिठन्, for it would have produced exactly the same forms ? True, as regards the words श्राणा and मांसौदन the affix ठञ् might have been employed instead of टिठन् ॥ According to some, however, the affix टिठन् applies to मांस and ओदन separately also. But ठञ् cannot be applied to ओदन as it would cause _Vriddhi_ (VII.2.117) which टिठन् does not. Thus ओदन् + टिठन् = ओदनिकः, f. ओदनिकी ॥ With ठञ् the form would have been औदनिकः which is not wanted.

The word श्राणा is a Past Participle (क्त) of श्राणा 'to cook.' The श्रा is not changed to श्रृ as required by (VI.1.27). This is an anomaly. The _nistha_ त is changed to ण (VIII.2.43). The form श्राता is also found, as in (VI. I. 36), and the regular form is शृतं = क्षीरम् (VI.1.27).
