Thus सर्वधुरां वहति = सर्वधुरीणः (VII.1.2). The affix ख applies to other compounds also ending in धुर, e.g. उत्तरधुरीणः, दक्षिनधुरीणः ॥ The word सर्वधुर is a compound of सर्वा + धुर् (II.1.49), the _samasanta_ अ being added by (V.4.74). The word धूः being feminine, the whole compound would be feminine by (II.4.26). The word सर्वधुरात् in the _sutra_ should not be taken, therefore, as regulating the gender, for though it is in the masculine gender, the affix comes after the feminine word. In fact सर्वधुर in the _sutra_ should be taken as a nominal-stem or _pratipadika_ equal to सवधुरा ॥
