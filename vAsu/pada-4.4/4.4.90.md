Thus गृहपतिना संयुक्तः = गार्हपत्यः 'the _Garhapatya_ Fire': i. e. a Fire particularly consecrated by the Householder. The word संज्ञायां of the last _sutra_ should be read into it, thus गार्हपत्यः means a particular Fire, and not every thing relating to a गृहपति ॥ The Fire in which husband (_grihapati_), together with or joined with his wife, performs sacrifice is called _Garhapatya_. That sacrifice cannot be performed in Dakshinagni. Or that fire in which _Grihapati_ hymns are recited is called _Garhapatya_.
