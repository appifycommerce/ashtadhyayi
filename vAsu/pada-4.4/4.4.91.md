sutra: नौवयोधर्मविषमूलमूलसीतातुलाभ्यस्तार्यतुल्यप्राप्यवद्ध्यानाम्यसमसमित सम्मितेषु
vRtti: नावादिभ्यो ऽष्टभ्यः शब्देभ्यो ऽष्टत्वेव तार्यादिष्वर्थेषु यथासंख्यं यत् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix यत् comes after the words नौ \'a boat\', वयस् \'age\', धर्म \'merit\', विष \'poison\', मूल \'a root\', मूल \'capital\', सीता \'furrow', and तुला \'a balance\', in the senses respectively, of 'to be crossed', 'like', 'attainable', 'to be put to death', 'to be bent down', 'equivalent to', 'united with' and 'equally measured'.

The words in the above must be all in the Instrumental case in construction, for the sense of the affix shows that it should be so. Thus.

1. नावा तार्यम् = नाव्यम् 'water' 'a river', lit what can be crossed by a boat.

2. वयसा तुल्यः = वयस्यः 'a friend', lit. one alike in age.

3. धर्मेण प्राप्यम् = धर्म्यम् 'what is attainable through _dharma_. Could not this form have been evolved by the next _sutra_ धर्मादनपेते (4.4.92) ? No, धर्म्यम् formed by that aphorism means 'what is consistent with _dharma_' 'what is just'. The present धर्म्य refers to the 'fruit', the other to the 'act'.

4. विषेण वध्यः = विष्यः 'who deserves to be put to death by poison'.

5. मूलेनानाम्यम् = मूल्यम् "price" lit. or to be overpowered or bent by the root". The word आनाम्य (which is formed from the root नम् 'to bow' by the affix ण्यत् contrary to rule (3.1.98) which reguired यत्), means अभिभवनीयम् 'what ought to be overpowered': hence मूल्यम् means 'the price, worth, cost', because articles like 'cloth' &c are produced by the out-lay of stock or capital (मूल); 'price' being a thing which, because it is capital plus profit, is superior to capital, and thus by price or _mulyam_, the capital or _mula_ is overpowered.

6. मूलेन समः = मूल्यः 'purchasable' lit, equivalent to capital' e.g. cloth पटः i. e. equivalent acquisition resulting from the employment of capital.

7. सीतया समितं = सीत्यं 'a field'. lit. 'measured out by furrows' according to Dr Ballantyne. The word समितं is equivalent to संगतं 'united with according to _Kasika_. सीत्यं therefore literally means 'a ploughed field' i. e. 'what is united with furrows'. The affix will apply also to words ending with सीता, e.g. परमसीत्यं, उत्तमसीत्यं, द्विसीत्यं ॥

8. तुलया सम्मितं = तुल्यम् "equal" lit. 'meted by the balance'. सम्मित means समानं, सदृशं ॥

Note:- The fruits of good deeds, like happiness &c, which are attainable or _prapya_ through '_dharma_', may be said also _dharmad_ _anapetam_ because an effect must have a cause. Hence arises the doubt as to what is the difference between this and the next _sutra_. The '_anapetam_' in the next _sutra_ means tho fulfilling or following the Law established by the _Shishthas_, and has no reference to its fruits. Because the effect of _dharma_ in to destroy _dharma_-- i.e. the fruits in the shape of happiness &c lessen, and ultimately extinguish the _dharma_. Therefore, the fruit of _dharma_, which is to be taken in this _sutra_, as referred to by the word _prapya_, ia diametrically opposed to the practising of _dharma_, referred to by the word _anapeta_ of the next _sutra_.
