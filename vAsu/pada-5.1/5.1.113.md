sutra: ऐकागारिकट् चौरे
vRtti: ऐकागारिकड् इति निपात्यते चौरेभिधेये ॥
vRtti_eng: The word ऐकागारिकट् is irregularly formed, in the sense of a 'thief'.
---
The feminine will be in ङीप्. Thus एकागारं प्रयोजनमस्य = ऐकागारिकः fem. °की ॥ This word can be regularly formed by ठञ्, but it will always be restricted to mean a thief. When any other thing is designated, it will not take this affix. Thus एकागारं प्रयोजनमस्य भिक्षाः, here there will be no affixing. The feminine moreover will be in ङीप् ॥ Some say the word is formed by adding the affix इकट् with the irregular _Vriddhi_ of the first syllable.
