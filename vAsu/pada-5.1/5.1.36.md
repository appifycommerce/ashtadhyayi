sutra: द्वित्रिपूर्वादण्च
vRtti: शाणाद्वेत्येव, द्वित्रिपूर्वाच्छाणान्तात्प्रातिपदिकादार्हीयेष्वर्थेषु अण् प्रत्ययो भवति, चकाराद्यच्च वा ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _an_ (+-- अ) as well as \"_yat_\" optionally also comes after the word _sana_, in the _arhiya_-senses (V. 1. 37) – (V. 1. 63), when preceded by the words द्वि and त्रि.
---
The यत् comes optionally by the last _sutra_ and is also drawn into this by the word च. Thus we have three forms, द्विशाण्यम्, द्वैशाणम्, and द्विशाणम्, so also त्रिशाण्यम्, त्रैशाणम् and त्रिशाणम् ॥
5.1.37.md‘’
The irregular _Vriddhi_ of the second term in cases of compounds of numerals, taught in (VII. 3. 15) - (VII. 3. 17), does not however take place in the case of शाण, this word being especially excluded from the operation of those rules, see (VII. 3. 17). The _Vriddhi_ here is regular as taught by the general rule (VII. 2. 117).
