sutra: तस्येश्वरः
vRtti: तस्येति षष्ठीसमर्थाभ्यां सर्वभूमिपृथिवीशब्दाभ्यामणञौ प्रत्ययौ भवत ईश्वर इत्येतस्मिन्विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: To the same bases _sarvabhumi_ and _prithivi_, are added the same affixes _an_ and _an_ respectively, in the sense of 'lord thereof'.

---
Thus सर्वभूमेरीश्वरः = सार्वभौमः 'the lord of the whole earth', पार्थिवः 'the lord of the earth'.

The word तस्य, showing the genitive construction of the base, has been repeated in this _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ was running into it from (5.1.38); in order to show that the senses given in (5.1.38) do not extend further. Had तस्य not been repeated here, the word ईश्वरः would have been an attribute, like the words संयोग and उत्पात, of the word निमित्तः ॥
