sutra: तस्य च दक्षिणा यज्ञाख्येभ्यः
vRtti: तस्येति षष्ठीसमर्थेभ्यो यज्ञाख्येभ्यो दक्षिणेत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे ठञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _than_, comes after a word being the name of a sacrifice, in the sense of 'the fee thereof'.

As अग्निष्टोमस्य दक्षिणा = आग्निष्टोमिकी, वाजपेयिकी, राजसूयिकी ॥

The word आख्या in the _sutra_ implies that the affix comes even after those sacrifice-denoting words which do not express time (V.1.78); had it not been used, the _sutra_ would have applied only to such sacrifice-denoting words as एकाहः, द्वादशाह, which are time-denoting words as well. The _Vartika_ in (V.1.20) would apply to द्वादशाह &c. Some texts do not read च in the _sutra_.
