sutra: धान्यानां भवने क्षेत्रे खञ्
vRtti: निर्देशादेव समर्थविभक्तिः । धान्यविशेषवाचिभ्यः षष्ठीसमर्थेभ्यो भवनेभिधेये खञ् प्रत्ययो भवति, तच्चेद्भवनं क्षेत्रं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix _khan_ (+-- ईन) comes after the name of any particular corn, being in genitive case in construction, in the sense of a place of growing, when that place is a field."
---
According to Bohtlingk, the _Sutra_ should be thus translated. "To a corn-name is added ईन, to express the fields in which the corn grows". According to Ballantyne, it is translated "when we speak of a place for grain, or a field of it, there may be the affix _khan_".

The word धान्यानां 'of grains', shows that the word in construction should be in the genitive case. The plural number shows that the affix is not to be added to the word-form धान्य, but to words which denote various kinds of _dhanya_ (I. 1.63). भवन means 'the place where a thing is produced or grows (भवन्ति जायन्ते)' ॥

Thus मुद्गानां भवनं क्षेत्रं = मौद्गीनम्, कौद्रवीणम्, कौलत्थीनम् ॥

Why do we say "of grains"? There will be no affixing in a case like this तृणानां भवनं क्षेत्रं ॥

Why do we say "when it is a field"? Observe मुद्गानां भवनं कुशूलं 'a granary where kidney-beans grow'.
