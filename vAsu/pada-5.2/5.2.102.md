sutra: तपः सहस्राभ्यां विनीनी
vRtti: तपः सहस्रशब्दाभ्यां विनि इनि इत्येतौ प्रत्ययौ भवतो मत्वर्थे ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affixes _vini_ (विन्) and _ini_ (इन्) come, with the force of _matup_, after the words _tapas_ and _sahasra_ respectively."

The word तपस् ends in अस्, and therefore by (V. 2. 121), it would have taken विनि; similarly सहस्र ends in अ, and by (V. 2. 115), it would have taken इनि; it may, therefore, be objected, where is the necessity for the present _sutra_? To this it is replied, that by the next _sutra_, these words take the affix अण् also; so that, had there not been this present _sutra_, the अण् would have debarred the application of इनि and विनि of (V. 2. 115) and (V. 2. 121). The affix ठन् (V. 1.115) is also debarred after the word सहस्र, though it ends in अ ॥

Thus तपोऽस्यास्मिन् वा विद्यते = तपस्विन् nom. तपस्वी ॥ Similarly सहस्रिन् nom. सहस्रा ॥
