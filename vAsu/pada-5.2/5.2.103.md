sutra: अण् च
vRtti: तपः सहस्राभ्यामण्च प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And also _an_ (+ अ) comes after _tapas_ and _sahasra_.
---
Thus तापसः, साहस्रः ॥ The separation of this _sutra_ from the last is for two purposes, Ist the _anuvritti_ of अण् runs in the subsequent _sutras_, which could not have been done had it been included in the last _sutra_, 2nd the rule of _yathasankhya_ (1. 3. 10) would not have applied in the last _sutra_, had अण् been read along with विनि and इनि ॥

Vart:- The words ज्योत्स्ना &c, are governed by this rule and take अण्. As ज्योत्स्ना विद्यतेऽस्मिन् पक्षे = ज्यौत्स्नः पक्षः ॥ Similarly तामिस्रः (a kind of hell) कौण्डलः, कौतपः, वैसर्पः, and वैपादिकः ॥
