sutra: समांसमां विजायते
vRtti: समांसमामिति वीप्सायां सुबन्तसमुदायः प्रकृतिः । विजायते गर्भे धारयतीति प्रत्ययार्थः । गर्भधारणेन सकलापि समा व्याप्यत इति अत्यन्तसंयोगे द्वितीया ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _kha_ comes after the word _samamsamam_ in the sense of 'who bears in the womb'.

---
The word विजायते means गर्भे धारयति 'who bears in the womb'. This verb governs the accusative of time समांसमां by (2.1.29). Thus समांसमां विजायते = समांसमीना गौः, समांसमीना वडवा ॥

Vart:- According to others the aphorism means 'the affix comes in the sense of to give birth to or to get a young'. i.e. विजायते = गर्भमोचनं ॥ According to them, the verb governs the locative: समायां समायां विजायते = समांसमीना, the य् of the first समायां being elided, the rest of the _vibhakti_ (आम्) remaining. The word will mean "an animal that gives birth to a young one every year".

Vart:- Sometime there is no affixing, but the whole sentence is to be used to express this meaning, or the य् only of both members is to be elided and a sentence formed. As समां समां विजायते or समयां समयां विजायते ॥
