sutra: ऊर्णाया युस्
vRtti: ऊर्णाशब्दाद्युस् प्रत्ययो भवति मत्वर्थे ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix युस् is added to ऊर्णा in the sense of _matup_, (in the _Chhandas_).
---
The स् of युस् makes the word ऊर्णा a पद (I. 4. 16); the result of which is that rules applicable to भ _Bha_ do not apply; e. g. (VI. I. 148), by which the final इ or ई, अ or आ is elided. Thus ऊर्णायुः ॥ According to some; छन्दसि is to be read in this _sutra_. The author of _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_ says that this is reasonable; for if _yus_ is added to _urna_ in secular literature also, then there was no necessity of this _sutra_. The word _urna_ could have been read along with _aham_ and _subham_ in (V. 2. 140).
