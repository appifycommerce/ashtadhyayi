sutra: पक्षात्तिः
vRtti: तस्येत्येव । तस्येति षष्ठीसमर्थात्पक्षशब्दात् मूलेभिधेये तिः प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _ti_ (ति) comes after the word _paksha_ in the genitive case in construction, in the sense of \"the root of it\".

The word मूल of the last _sutra_ is drawn into this aphorism; and not the word पाक as well. This is an exceptional case of अनुवृत्ति, generally the whole is drawn and not a portion. Hence arises the following maxim क्वचिदेकदेशोऽप्यनुवर्तते "Sometimes it also happens that only a part of the words of a rule which are mutually connected is valid in a subsequent rule, while the rest ceases to be valid".

Thus पक्षस्य मूलं = पक्षतिः i. e. प्रतिपत् 'the root or the first day of a _Paksha_ or a fortnight'.
