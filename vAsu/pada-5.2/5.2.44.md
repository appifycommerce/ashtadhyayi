sutra: उभादुदात्तो नित्यम्
vRtti: उभशब्दात्परस्य तयपो नित्यमयजादेशो भवति स चोदात्तः ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the word _ubha_, _ayach_ is always the substitute for _tayap_, having the acute (_udatta_) accent on its first syllable."
---
The affix अयच् having indicatory च् takes the acute accent on the final syllable (VI. 1. 163), i. e. on य, the special mention of the _udatta_ in the  _sutra_ shows that the accent should be on a syllable which would otherwise not have taken it i. e. the first syllable i. e. अ; for had this not been the meaning, there was no necessity of using the word _udatta_ in the _sutra_.

If उभ is a _Sankhya_ word (1. 1. 23) in the secular sense, it would have taken तयप्, the present _sutra_ ordains अय instead as a substitute always. If it is not a _Sankhya_, then we should first ordain तयप् after it, by the process of splitting the _sutra_ (V. 2. 42) _ante_ into two, thus संख्यायाः तयप्, अवयवे तयप् and then replace तयप् by अय ॥

Thus उभौ पीतलोहितौ अवयवौ यस्य = उभयः ॥ उभये देवमनुष्याः; उभयोः मणिः ॥
