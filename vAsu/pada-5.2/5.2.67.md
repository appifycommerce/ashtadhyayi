sutra: उदराट्ठगाद्यूने
vRtti: तत्रेत्येव, प्रसित इति च । उदरशब्दात्सप्तमीसमर्थात्प्रसित इत्येतस्मिन्नर्थे ठक् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix _thak_ (+- इक) comes in the sense of 'voracious', after the word _udara_."

The translation given above is according to Dr. Bohtlingk. According to the _Kasika_, the _anuvritti_ of प्रसित is also read into this _sutra_. The meaning then would be _thak_ comes after the word _udara_ in the seventh case in construction, in the sense of 'who is devoted therein', when the word so formed means "voracious". A person who is very much distressed by hunger is so called; उदरेऽविजिगीषुर्भण्यते ॥ Thus उदरे प्रसितः = औदरिकः (i.e. आद्यूनः).

Why do we say when it means 'voracious'? Observe उदरकः 'abdominal'.
