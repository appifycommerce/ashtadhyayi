sutra: शृङ्खलमस्य बन्धनं करभे
vRtti: शृङ्खलशब्दात्प्रथमासमर्थादस्येति षष्ठ्यर्थे कन्प्रत्ययो भवति, यत्तत्प्रथमासमर्थे बन्धनं चेत्तद्भवति, यत्तदस्येति निर्दिष्टं करभश्चेत्स भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _kan_ comes after the word _srinkhala_ 'a clog', in the sense of 'clog is its fetter', when the whole word means a young camel.

Thus शृंखलं बन्धनमस्य करभस्य = शृंखलकः ॥  The young ones of camel are called करभ ॥ The wooden clogs put on their feet to prevent them from straying are called शृंखल ॥ Though the ropes &c are also used along with the clog, yet _srinkhala_ being the principal object that takes away the freedom is called बन्धन or bond or fetter.
