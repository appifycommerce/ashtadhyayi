sutra: सपूर्वाच्च
vRtti: विद्यमानं पूर्वं यस्मादिति सपूर्वे प्रातिपदिकम् । तस्य पूर्वशब्देन तदन्तविधिः । सपूर्वात्प्रातिपदिकात्पूर्वशब्दान्तादनेनेत्यस्मिन्नर्थे इनिः प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix _ini_ comes after the word _purva_, also when another word precedes it, the sense being 'by whom something is done'."

Thus कृतपूर्वी कटम् = पूर्वं कृतमनेन 'who formerly made'. भुक्तपूर्वी ओदनम् ॥

In these words, first कृत and पूर्व are compounded by (II. 1. 4); and then the affix is added. These two _sutras_ (V. 2. 86), (V. 2. 87), give rise to these two maxims ग्रहनवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति "that which cannot possibly be anything but a _Pratipadika_ or Nominal-stem, does, (contrary to (l. 1.72)) not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself." व्यपदेशिवद्भावोऽप्रातिपदिकेन "The rule of _vyapadesivad_-_bhava_ does not apply to a _pratipadika_". That rule is embodied in the following _paribhasha_- व्यपदेशिवदेकस्मिन् -- "an operation which affects some thing on account of some special designation, which for certain reasons attaches to the latter, affects likewise that which stands alone and to which therefore, just because the reasons for it do not exist, that special designation does not attach".
