sutra: पूरणाद्भागे तीयादन्
vRtti: पूरणप्रत्ययो यस्तीयस्तदन्तात्प्रातिपदिकाद्भागे वर्त्तमानात्स्वार्थेऽन् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After (a nominal stem being) an ordinal number ending in _tiya_, comes the affix अन् (/- अ), (the word retaining its denotation), when a \"part\" is meant.

This _sutra_ is made only to teach accent, for the word to which अन् is added undergoes no other change of form except in accent. Thus द्वितीयः (V. 2. 54) has _udatta_ on ती (III. 1. 3) but when अन् is added, the accent falls on द्वि (VI. I. 197). Thus द्वितीयो भागः = द्वितीयः 'the moiety'. Similarly तृतीयः 'the one-third'. Why do we say when 'part' is meant? Otherwise, there is no change in accent. The affix तीय always comes in forming ordinal numbers and for no other purpose, for the तीय in words like मुखतीय is not significant as it is not an affix. The employment of the word पूरण in the aphorism is useless for the purposes of this _sutra_. Its _anuvritti_, however, runs in the other _sutras_, and that is the only purpose that it serves here.
