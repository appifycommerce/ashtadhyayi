sutra: तिङश्च
vRtti: तिङन्ताच्चातिशायने द्योत्ये तमप् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: So also after a finite verb, comes the affix _tamap_, when 'surpassing' is meant.

By ङ्याप्प्रातिपदिकात् (IV. I. I) whose force runs throughout, the _taddhita_ affixes are ordained only after nominal stems; they would not have come after verbs, hence this _sutra_. Thus पचतितमाम् (the आम् is added by (V. 4. 11) = सर्व इमे पचन्तीति, अयमेषामतिशयेन पचति, 'he cooks surprisingly'. जल्पतितमाम् &c. The affix इष्ठन् never comes after a verb, as by (V. 3. 58), it is restricted to adjectives.
