sutra: पादशतस्य संख्यादेर्वीप्सायां वुन्लोपश्च
vRtti: पादशतान्तस्य संख्यादेः प्रातिपदिकस्य वीप्सायां द्योत्यायां वुन् प्रत्ययो भवति । तत्सन्नियोगेन चान्तस्य लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _vun_ (-- अक) comes after the words _pada_ and _sata_ when preceded by a numeral, the sense being that of distributive relation; and the final of the stem is elided.

_Pratipadikas_ preceded by a numeral and ending in the words पाद or शत take the affix वुन् when a distributive sense (वीप्सा) is to be expressed: and by the addition of this, the final is elided.

By (V1.4. 148) the final अ of _pada_ and _sata_ would have been elided before the _taddhita_ affix _vun_; even if such elision was not taught in this rule. The repetition of the word लोप in this rule, therefore, indicates that the elision ordained here is not one caused by the affix. For if the elision had been caused by the affix, then by (I.1.57), such लोपादेश or "substitute" would be equivalent to the principal (_sthanivat_); and would thus debar the application of the rule (VI.4.130) by which पाद् _pad_ (and not _pada_) is changed into पद् ॥ In other words, the _lopa_ taught by यस्येति च is परनिमित्तक or caused by some thing which is subsequent, namely by a _taddhita_ affix or by इ or ई affix; therefore, this _lopa_ would be _sthani_-_vat_ for the purposes of the rule which would apply to something preceding it (1. 1. 57). Therefore, _pad_ becomes _sthani_-_vat_ to _pada_. Therefore, the _anga_ or base ending with '_pada_' will be called भ, and not the base ending with '_pad_', and therefore (VI.4.130) which applies to भ bases will not apply, and there will be no substitution of पद् for पाद्, as there is not in the form पादाय. But we want such substitution and hence the employment of words "the final of the stem is elided".

Thus द्वौ द्वौ पादौ ददाति "he gives two quarters to each" = द्विपदिकां ददाति (द्विपाद + वुन् = द्विपाद् + वुन् = द्विपत् + वुन्) (VI.4.130) = द्विपदिका (VII.3.44) by which अ of अक् is changed into इ). Similarly द्वे द्वे शते ददाति = द्विशतिकां ददाति ॥

The compounds above formed are _taddhitartha_ _Tatpurusha_ compounds, viz. compounds containing the sense of a _taddhita_ affix, by rule (II. I. 51). After the compound is formed, then the affix वुन् is added. Thus first we have द्विपाद and द्विशत compounded by (II. I. 51) and then the affix is added. The words पाद and शत when not so compounded, take वुन् affix only in the feminine.

Why do we say "of the words पाद and शत"? Observe द्वौ द्वौ माषौ ददाति, no affixing. Why do we say "preceded by a numeral?" Observe पादं पादं ददाति ॥ Why do we say "in a distributive sense"?  Observe द्वौपादौ ददाति "He gives two quarters:" द्वे शते ददाति ॥

The enumeration of पाद and शत is useless, as the affix is found after other words also. As, द्विमोदकिकां ददाति "he gives two cakes to each". त्रिमोदकिकां ददाति ॥
