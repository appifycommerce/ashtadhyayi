sutra: अर्द्धाच्च
vRtti: अर्द्धशब्दात्परो यो नौशब्दस्तदन्तात्तत्पुरुषाट्टच्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _tach_ comes after the word _nau_, when preceded by the word _ardha_, in a _Tatpurusha_ compound.

---
Thus अर्द्धं नावः = अर्द्धनावम् ॥ The compounding takes place by (II.2.2). The compound is of neuter gender, and does not take the gender of the term as required by (II.4.26): for gender is regulated by usage more than any grammatical rules (लोकाश्रयत्वं लिङ्गस्य) ॥
