sutra: बहुव्रीहौ सक्थ्यक्ष्णोः स्वाङ्गात्षच् ॥
vRtti: स्वाङ्गवाची यः सक्थिशब्दोऽक्षिशब्दश्च तदन्ताद्बहुव्रीहेः षच् प्रत्ययो भवति समासान्तः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _shach_ comes after the words _sakthi_ and _akshi_, final in a _Bahuvrihi_ compound and denoting a portion of one's body.

Thus दीर्घे सक्थि यस्य = दीर्घसक्थः, so also कल्याणाक्षः, लोहिताक्षः, विशालाक्षः ॥ The word सक्ष्टपक्ष्णोः is genitive dual, while it ought to be ablative. Why do we say "in a _Bahuvrihi_ compound"? Observe परमसक्थिः, परमाक्षिः ॥ Why do we say "after _sakthi_ and _akshi_?" Observe दीर्घजानुः, सुबाहुः ॥ Why do we say "when denoting a part of the body?" Observe दीर्घसक्थि शकटं, स्थूलक्षिरिक्षुः ॥

The new affix षच् is employed instead of टच् for the sake of the accent Thus चक्रसक्थी स्त्री, दीर्घसक्थी स्त्री ॥ By _sutra_ (IV.1.41) the feminine of words ending in an affix having an indicatory ष् is formed by ङीष् and not ङीप् ॥ Had the affix here been टच्, then the feminine would have been formed by ङीप्  (IV.1.15), which is _anudatta_ (III.1.4). Now by rule (VI.2.198) the second term '_saktha_' has optionally _udatta_ accent, on this final in a _Bahuvrihi_. When therefore, it is not oxytone, then by adding ङीप् the final of दीर्घसक्थी would have been _anudatta_, so that the feminine in one case would be oxytone, in the other not, which would be anomalous. But when ङीष्  is added, it is always _udatta_, which is desired: and removes the anomaly. The _anuvritti_ of _Bahuvrihi_ extends up to the end of the chapter.
