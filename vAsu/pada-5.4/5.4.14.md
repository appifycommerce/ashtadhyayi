sutra: णचः स्त्रियामञ्
vRtti: कर्मव्यतिहारे णच् स्त्रियामिति णज्विहितः, तदन्तात्स्वार्थेऽञ् प्रत्ययो भवति स्त्रियां विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix _an_ (अ) comes without changing the sense, after a word ending in the affix _nach_ (+/-- अ), when the word is feminine."
---
By (III. 3. 43) the affix णच् is ordained after feminine words denoting reciprocity of action. The affix अञ् comes after such a word without changing the sense, when the thing denoted is feminine Thus व्यावक्रोशी, व्यावहासी वर्त्तते ॥

Q.-Why the word स्त्री "feminine" is repeated in this _sutra_, when we already know from (III. 3. 43) that णच् comes only after feminine words; and a _svarthika_ affix like अञ् coming after a feminine word will keep the word feminine?.

Ans.- The repetition of the word स्त्री in this _sutra_, teaches by implication (_jnapaka_) the following "स्वार्थिकाः प्रत्ययाः प्रकृतितो लिंगवचनान्यतिवर्त्तन्तेऽपि" :- "Sometimes it happens that bases which are derived by means of affixes that do not convey any particular meaning of their own, but leave the meaning which is conveyed by the original to which they are added, unchanged, do not take their gender and number from those original bases from which they are derived". Thus गुडकल्पा द्राक्षा, तैलकल्पा प्रसन्ना (सुरा विशेषः) formed by adding the _swartha_ affix कल्प (V. 3. 67) to गुड and तैल, the resultant words being in the feminine gender. Similarly from देव-देवता is derived without change of meaning, but change of gender.
