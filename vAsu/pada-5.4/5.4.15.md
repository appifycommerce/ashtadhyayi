sutra: अणिनुणः
vRtti: अभिविधो भाव इनुण् विहितस्तदन्तात्स्वार्थेऽण् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _an_ (+- अ) comes without changing the sense, after a stem ending in the affix _inun_ (इनुण्).

By (III.3.44), the affix इनुण् is added to a root to express a condition resulting from a universal co-operation of the action denoted by the root. But a word formed by इनुण् is after all an imaginary word, it requires the further addition of this affx अण् to make it a complete word. In fact, all _svartha_ affixes generally complete the not fully developed word. Thus सांराविणम् वर्त्तते, सांकूटिनम् ॥
