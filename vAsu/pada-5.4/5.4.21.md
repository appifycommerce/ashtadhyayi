sutra: तत्प्रकृतवचने मयट्
vRtti: तदिति प्रथमा समर्थविभक्तिः, प्राचुर्येण प्रस्तुत प्रकृतम् । प्रथमासमर्थात् प्रकृतोपाधिकेर्थे वर्त्तमानात्स्वार्थे मयट् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _mayat_ (मय with the feminine in grave ई) is added to a word in first case in construction, when the sense is 'made thereof', or 'subsisting therein'.

The translation of the _sutra_ given above is according to the rendering of Prof. Bohtlingk. According to _Kasika_: तत् signifies that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the nominative case, (IV. 1. 82) the word प्रकृतम् means "happening to be in abundance". So that according to this interpretation the _sutra_ should be translated, as done by Dr. Ballantyne, "The affix _mayat_ may be employed after a word denoting some substance, when we require an expression for it as abundant". Thus अन्नं प्रकृतम् = अन्नमयम्  "abundance of food", अपूपमयम् "abundance of cake". According to others, that in which there is abundance of the thing signified by the word to which the affix मयट् is added, is denoted by the whole word. Thus अन्नं प्रकृतमस्मिन् = अन्नमयो यज्ञः "a feast in which there is abundance of food". अपूपमयं पर्व, वटकमयोयात्रा ॥ Both senses are possible, as the _sutra_ is constructed.

"The word वचन in the _sutra_ has two senses. It being made by the affix ल्युट् conveys the force both of the nature (III. 3. 114) and the site. In the former case, (taking, तत् प्रकृतवचन to mean "the mention of that as abundant)", we have अन्नमयम् "abundance of grain". But in the second case, (taking it to mean "that in which something is spoken of as abundant)" we have अन्नमयो यज्ञः "sacrifice at which food is abundant". (Dr. Ballantyne's _Laghukaumudi_).
