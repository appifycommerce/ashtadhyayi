sutra: विभाषा साति कार्त्स्न्ये
vRtti: अभूततद्भावे कृभ्वस्तियोगे संपद्यकर्त्तरीति सर्वमनुवर्त्तते । अस्मिन्विषये विभाषा सातिः प्रत्ययो भवति कार्त्स्न्ये गम्यमाने ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _sati_ may be employed optionally in the sense of _chvi_, when something is changed in all its parts into something else.

The whole phrase "when the agent has attained to a state it previously had not and the verbs _kri_, _bhu_ and _asti_ are in conjunction", is understood here. The affix साति is employed when the original is changed in its totality (कृत्स्न). Thus अग्निसाद् भवति शस्त्रम् "the whole weapon is in a blaze-- has become fire". We may also say अग्नी भवति शस्त्रम् ॥ So also उदकसाद् भवति लवणम् or उदकी भवति लवणम् "The salt becomes all water".

Why do we say "in its totality"? Observe एकदेशेन पटः शुक्ली भवति "the cloth whitens in part".

The word "optionally" shows that the affix _chvi_ also comes in the same sense. While the optional affixing of these terminations _chvi_, _sati_ &c is governed by the _Maha_-_vibhasha_ of _sutra_ (4.1.82) (see (5.3.1).
