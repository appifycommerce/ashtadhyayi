sutra: देये त्रा च
vRtti: तदधीनवचन इत्यनुवर्तते । तस्य विशेषणं देयग्रहणम् । दातव्यं देयं, तदधीने देये त्रा प्रत्ययो भवति चकारात्सातिश्च कृभ्वस्तिभिः संपदा च योगे ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix _tra_ comes in the sense of 'to be given to that', as well as the affix _sati_, in conjunction with the above verbs _kri_, _bhu_, _asti_ and _sampad_."

The phrase "dependent upon that" is understood here also. The word देय qualifies the above phrase. When a thing which is known as a proper gift for the _Brahmanas_, is put under their control by offering it to them, then the affix _tra_ is employed. Thus ब्राह्मणाधीनं देयं करोति = ब्राह्मणत्रा or ब्राह्मणसात् करोति "He gives it to the _Brahmanas_, as it is an object which ought to be given to them". ब्राह्मणत्रा भवति "it becomes given to the _Brahmans_". So also with यात् and संपद्यते ॥ Why do we say "when the sense is that of to be given"? Observe राजसाद् भवति राष्ट्रम् ॥
