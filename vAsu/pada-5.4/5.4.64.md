sutra: दुःखात्प्रातिलोम्ये
vRtti: कृञ इत्येव । दुःखशब्दात्प्रातिपदिकात्प्रातिलोम्ये गम्यमाने डाच् प्रत्ययो भवति कृञो योगे ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _dach_ comes after the word _duhkha_ followed by _kri_, when meaning to do something against the grain or "to contravene".
---
The verb कृ is understood and _pratilomya_ means 'to oppose' or "to act against another's wishes", "to pain the heart of one's master &c". As दुःखा करोति भृत्यः "the servant pains the master".

Why do we say "when meaning to go against the grain"? Observe दुःखं करोति कदन्नम् ॥
