sutra: सत्यादशपथे
vRtti: कृञ इत्येव । सत्यशब्दादशपथे डाच् प्रत्ययो भवति कृञो योगे ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _dach_ comes after the word _satya_; followed by _kri_, when not meaning to swear.

The word सत्य means 'truth' as opposed to 'falsehood'. Sometimes it means to swear, as in the sentence "सत्येन शापयेद् विप्रम्" ॥ This latter sense is prohibited. Thus सत्या करोति वनिक् भाण्डम् "the merchant concludes the bargain of the goods i. e. he settles that he will purchase these wares". Why do we say 'when not meaning to swear'? Observe सत्यं करोति ब्राह्मणः "the _Brahmana_ swears".
