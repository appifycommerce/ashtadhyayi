vRtti: अधिकारोयमापादपरिसमाप्तेर्थे प्रत्यया विहितास्ते समासस्यान्तावयवा एकादेशा भवन्ति, तद्ग्रहणेन गृह्यन्त इति वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: The following affixes are added to the ends of compounds without changing their sense.

This is an _adhikara_ or regulating _sutra_: and governs all _sutras_ upto the end of this chapter. All the affixes to be ordained here after become the final part and integral portion of a compound, so that whenever a compound is formed, these affixes must be added to complete the compound. These affixes are useful in forming the _Avyayibhava_, the _Dvigu_, the _Dvandva_, the _Tatpurusha_ and the _Bahu_-_vrihi_ compounds: in fact so long as these affixes are not added, the compounds do not get the designation of _Avyayibhava_ &c. Thus उप + राजन् = उपराजन् : now before this word can be properly called an _Avyayibhava_, we must elide the final अन् by adding the _samasanta_ affix डच् (V.4.108), and we get the form उपराज, to which अम् is added by (II.4.83) and we have उपराजम्, so also अधिराजं ॥ So also द्विपुरी, त्रिपुरी the _samasanta_ अ being added to पुर् by (V.4.74), then the feminine affix ङीप् by (IV.1.21), the whole word द्विपुर being called _Dvigu_. So also, कटकवलयिनी and शङ्खनूपुरिणी ॥ Here the affix इनि (V.2.128) is added to the whole, _samasanta_ word कटकवलय &c which gets the name of _Dvandva_. Similarly विधु꣡रः (विगतोधुरः), प्र꣡धुरः (प्रगतोधुरः). Here the whole _samasanta_ (V.4.74) word gets the name of _Tatpurusha_, and hence the first member retains its accent by (VI.2.2), namely _udatta_. (_phit_ IV. 12 and 13) उचैर्धुरः, नीच꣡र्धुरः being _Bahuvrihi_, the first member retains its accent, namely acute on the final, as उचैः, नीचैः have been taught as _antodatta_ in the very list of _Svaradi_ (l. 1. 37).

As a general rule all affixes come at the end of a word (II.1.2), what is the use of employing the word "_anta_" in this _sutra_? It means that when words like _avyayibhava_ &c are employed, they mean words having those affixes already at their end. Thus the _Dvigu_ compound of द्वि॑ + धुर = द्विधुर् + अ (V.4.74) = द्विधुरः so that when rule (IV.1.21) says that the feminine of _Dvigu_ compounds ending in अ take ई, it refers to _Dvigu_ compounds which have already taken the _samasanta_ affix अ, otherwise the rule (IV.1.21) would not have applied, for strictly speaking द्विधुर् ends in र् _r_ and not in  अ ॥ Similarly rule (V.2.128) ordaining इनि after _Dvandva_ compounds, means that the affix comes after a _Dvandva_ compound that has already taken the _samasanta_ affix टच् (V.4.106), as कोश + निषत् = कोश + निषद् + टच् (V.4.106) कोशनिषदं, कोशनिषदिनी ॥
