sutra: अषडक्षाशितङ्ग्वलंकर्मालं पुरुषान्युत्तरपदात्खः
vRtti: अषडक्ष आशितंगु अलंकर्म अलंपुरुष इत्येतेभ्योऽप्युत्तरपदाच्च स्वार्थे खः प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix kha (ईन) comes after the words _ashadaksha_, _asitangu_, _alankarma_, _alampurusha_, and after a stem ending with _adhi_.

---
The force of ख is स्वार्थ i e. it does not change the sense of the word. The word अषडक्ष means "that which has not six eyes". षडक्ष is compounded from षट् + अक्ष्णि by adding षच् (V.4.113) "having six eyes". The affix ख is to be added to this word already ending in the affix _shach_. Thus अषडक्षीणे मन्त्रः "a secret not having six eyes". i. e. "a secret known or determined by two persons only to the exclusion of a third". Similarly आशितंगवीनं अरण्यम् = आशिता गावोऽस्मिन्नरण्ये = प्रभूतयवसं "a forest where formerly cattle had grazed". The augment मुम् is added to आशित by _nipata_, or irregularly. So also अलंकर्मीणः = अलं समर्थः कर्मणे पर्याप्तः = competent to do any act, clever. So अलं पुरुषीणः = अलं समर्थः पुरुषाय = प्रतिमल्लादिः = fit for a man.

A word ending with अधि, will be a _Tatpurusha_ compound, by (II. I. 40), as the word अधि belongs to _Saundadi_ class. As राजाधीनः ॥

The affix _kha_ in the case of these words is invariable (_nitya_), because the word विभाषा occurs in the next _sutra_; and it is a maxim of interpretation that a rule occurring between two optional rules is _nitya_. The above words always occur with this affix and never without it. while in the case of other words taught hereafter this affix comes optionally. There are other affixes also which are _svarthika_ and _nitya_. Such as तमप् &c up to the affix कन् (V.3.55) to (V.3.95) भ्य &c upto वुन् (V.3.112) to (V.4.1) आम् &c upto मयट्, (V.4.11) to (V.4.21) and affixes taught from (V.4.6) i.e. कन् to (V.4.9). (ख). ending in जाति and all _Samasanta_ affixes.
