sutra: अक्ष्णोऽदर्शनात्
vRtti: अजित्यनुवर्त्तते । दर्शनादन्यत्र योऽक्षिशब्दस्तदन्तादच् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix _ach_ comes after the word _akshi_ when not meaning 'the eye'."

The word अच् is understood here. Thus लवणाक्षम्, पुष्कराक्षम् ॥ These are _Tatpurusha_ metaphors formed by (II. I. 56).

Why do we say "when not meaning the eye"? Observe ब्राह्मणाक्षि ॥ How do you explain the forms कबराक्षः, गवाक्षः, which apparently contradict this rule, because कबराक्ष is a many-holed leather horse-veil through which the horses can see, and so also गवाक्ष is a window through which men see? This is no fault. The word दर्शन in the _sutra_ does not mean 'to see', here, but is a synonym of 'eye'.
