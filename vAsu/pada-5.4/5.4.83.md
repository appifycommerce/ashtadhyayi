sutra: अनुगवमायामे
vRtti: अनुगवमित्यच् प्रत्ययान्तं निपात्यते आयामेऽभिधेये ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _anugava_ is irregularly formed by adding the affix _ach_, and has the sense of 'suited to the length of the cows'.

Thus अनुगवं यानं "the chariot suited to the length of the oxen". This compound is formed by (II. 1. 16). Why do we say when meaning "the length"? Observe, गवां पश्चाद् = अनुगु ॥
