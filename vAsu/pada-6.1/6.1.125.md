sutra: प्लुतप्रगृह्या अचि
vRtti: प्लुताश्च प्रगृह्याश्चाचि प्रकृत्या भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Pluta_ ((VIII. 2. 82) etc.) and _Pragrihya_ ((I. 1. 11) etc.) vowels remain unaltered when followed by a vowel (so far as the operation of that vowel is concerned).

Thus देवदत्ता ३ अत्र न्वसि, यज्ञदत्ता ३ इदम् आनय ॥ These are examples of prolated vowels. The prolation of vowels is taught in the _tripadi_ or the last three chapters of _Ashtadhyayi_; and the _tripadi_ are considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of previous _sutras_ (VIII.2.1.). This is not the case here, otherwise the mention of _pluta_ would be redundant. Of the Excepted or _Pragrihya_ vowels the following are the examples : अग्नी इति, वायू इति, खट्वे इति, माले इति ॥ Though the _anuvritti_ of अचि was current in this _sutra_ from (VI.1.77): its repetition here is for the sake of ordaining प्रकृतिभाव ॥ That is, the _pluta_ and the _pragrihya_ retain their original forms when such a vowel follows which would have caused a substitution. Thus जानु उ अस्य, रुजति here in combining जानु + उ into जानू, the अ is no cause of lengthening, therefore, the lengthening will take place. Now since उ is a _pragrihya_, it follows that जानू which ends in उ is also a _pragrihya_, and therefore it should not be changed before  अ of अस्य ॥ Hence we have the form जानू + अस्य = जानू अस्य ॥ There may also be the form जान्वस्य, not by इकोयणचि, but by मय उञो वो वा (VIII.3.33). In fact, the repetition of अचि in this _sutra_ is necessary, in order to enable us to give this peculiar meaning to the _sutra_. Otherwise, had the _sutra_ been simply प्लुतप्रगृह्याः, it would have been translated ordinarily thus: "The _Pluta_ and _Pragrihya_ retain their form, when ever a vowel follows". Therefore in जानु उ अस्य, since उ is followed by a vowel, it will retain its form, and will not coalesce with the उ of जानु ॥ But this is not intended. Hence the repetition of the word अचि, and the peculiar explanation given above, namely, _Pluta_ and _Pragrihya_ vowels retain their form before a vowel which would otherwise have caused a substitution, but it would not prevent the operation of any other rule. Therefore in जानु उ अस्य रुजति, the उ + उ will become lengthened, because अ is not the cause of lengthening; it causes the change of उ to व्, which of course is prevented. The word नित्य of the last _sutra_ is understood here also. These _pluta_ and _pragrihya_ always retain their form and are not influenced by the rule of shortening given in (VI.1.127).
