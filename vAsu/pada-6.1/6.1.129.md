sutra: अप्लुतवदुपस्थिते
vRtti: उपस्थितं नामानार्ष इतिकरणः समुदायादवच्छिद्य पदं येन स्वरूपेऽवस्थाप्यते तस्मिन्परतोऽप्लुतवद्भवति ॥ प्लुतकार्ये प्रकृतिभावं न करोति ॥
vRtti_eng: "Before the word इति in the _Padapatha_, a _Pluta_ vowel is treated like an ordinary _apluta_ vowel."
---
The word उपस्थित means the affixing of इति in non-_Rishi_ texts; i, e. when a Vedic text is split up into its various _padas_ or words and इति is added. That is in _Padapatha_, the _Pluta_ is treated like an ordinary vowel, and hence there being no प्रकृतिभाव (VI. 1. 125), there is _sandhi_. Thus सुश्लोका ३ इति = सुश्लोकेति, सुमङ्गला इति = सुमंगलेति ॥ Why have we used the word वत् "like as"; instead of saying "the _Pluta_ becomes _Apluta_" why do we say "_Pluta_ is treated like _apluta_"? By not using वत्, the whole _Pluta_ itself would be changed into _Apluta_, and would give rise to the following incongruity. There is _prakriti_ _bhava_ in the case of _pluta_ and _pragrihya_. A vowel which is _pluta_ need not be _pragrihya_, nor a _pragrihya_, a _pluta_. But where a vowel is both a _pluta_ and a _pragrihya_ at one and the sametime, there will arise the difficulty. Thus in the dual अग्नी or वायू, the इ and ऊ are _pragrihya_. They may be made _pluta_ also as अग्ना ३ or वायू ३ ॥ Now if before इति, the _pluta_ became _apluta_, then we shall not hear the prolation at all in अग्नी इति वायू इति formed by अग्नी ३ + इति &c. For here the vowels will retain their form by being _pragrihya_ by (VI. I. 125), and in addition to that they will lose their _pluta_, by the present rule. But this is not intended. Hence the _pluta_ is heard in अग्नी ३ इति, वायू ३ इति ॥
