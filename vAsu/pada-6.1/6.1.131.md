sutra: दिव उत्
vRtti: एङः पदान्तादतीत्यतः पदग्रहणमनुवर्त्तते । दिव इति प्रातिपदिकं गृह्यते न धातुः, सानुबन्धकत्वात् ॥
vRtti_eng: "For the final of the nominal-stem दिव्, there is the substitution of उ, when it is a _Pada_ (I. 4. 14) &c))."

The portion पद of the word पदान्त must be read into this _sutra_ from (VI. 1. 109). The word दिव् is here a nominal-stem and not a verbal-root. Thus दिवि कामो यस्य = द्युकामः, द्युमान्, विमलद्यु दिनं, द्युभ्याम्, द्युर्भिः ॥ We have said that दिव् is here a _pratipadika_ and not a _dhatu_, for as a _dhatu_ it ought to have its servile letter _anubandha_ and should have been read as दिवु ॥ In the case of its being used as a verb, there takes place the substitution of long ऊ for व् by (VI. 4. 19). In that case we shall have अक्षद्यूभ्याम्, अक्षद्यूभिः ॥ The उत् with a त् shows that short उ is meant, and debars ऊठ (VI. 4. 19). In the case of ऊठ् substitution the forms will be द्यूभ्याम्, द्यूभिः ॥ The ऊठ् also comes because it is taught in a subsequent _sutra_. Why do we say 'when it is a _Pada_'? Observe दिवौ, दिवः ॥
