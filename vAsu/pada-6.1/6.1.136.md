sutra: अडभ्यासव्यवायेपि
vRtti: अड्व्यवायेऽभ्यासव्यवाये सुट् कात्पूर्वो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The augment सुट् is placed before क even when the augment अट् (VI. 4. 71) or the Reduplicate intervenes (between the preposition and the verb)."

Thus समस्करोत् (= सम् + अकरोत्), समस्कार्षीत्, संचस्कार (= सम् + चकार), परिचस्कार ॥ This _sutra_ is not that of _Panini_, but is made out of two _Vartikas_:अड् व्यवाय उपसंख्यानाम्; and अभ्यासव्यवाये च ॥ The augmented root स्कृ would have given the form चस्कार by (VII. 4. 61), if स् be considered an integral part of कृ, and no rule of _Antaranga_ and _Bahiranga_ be taken into consideration. It might be said where is the necessity then of this _sutra_? The operation relating to a _Dhatu_ and _Upasarga_ is _Antaranga_, i. e. a root is first joined with the _Upasarga_, and it undergoes other operations afterwards. Therefore, first the augment सुट् is added, and then the अट् and आभ्यास operations take place. Thus संस्कृ is the form to which अट् and अभ्यास operations are to be applied. Now, we have said in the foregoing aphorism, that सुट् is considered as unattached to क; and therefore, the augment अट् may be added after this सुट्, and so also the reduplication may take place without it. Thus we may have the forms like संस्करोत् and संस्चकार ॥ But this is not desired, hence the necessity of the present _sutra_ teaching that even after अट् and reduplicate, the सुट् must be placed before क and no where else.
