आगमस्य विकारस्य प्रकृतेः प्रत्ययस्य च ।
पृथक्स्वरनिवृत्त्यर्थमेकवर्जं पदस्वरः ॥

That is, only one syllable in a word is accented, all the rest are _anudatta_ or unaccented. This is a _Paribhasha_ or maxim of interpretation with regard to the laws of accent. Wherever an accent-be it acute (_udatta_) or a circumflex (_svarita_) is ordained with regard to a word, there this maxim must be applied, to make all the other syllables of that word unaccented. The word अनुदात्त means 'having an _anudatta_ vowel'. What is the one to be excepted? That one about which any particular accent has been taught in the rules here-in-after given. Thus (VI. I. 162) teaches that a root has acute accent on the final. Therefore, with the exception of the last syllable, all the other syllables are unaccented. Thus in गोपाय꣡ति the acute accent is on य, all the rest are unaccented. The root accent is superseded by आ accent, thus लुना꣡ति has acute accent on ना ॥ The  आ accent is superseded by तस् accent, as लुनीतः꣡, has accent on तः ॥ The तस् accent is superseded by आम् accent, as लुनीतस्तरा꣡म् ॥

आगमस्य विकारस्य प्रकृतेः प्रत्ययस्य च, पृथक् स्वरनिवृत्यर्थमेकवर्जं पदस्वरः ॥ The words 'with the exception of one syllable' show that the separate accent of an augment, or a preparative element, or a stem or an affix should cease, when a particular accent is taught for a word'. Thus as to (1) augment:-(VII. 1. 98) teaches "आम् acutely accented is the augment of चतुर् and अनडुह् when a _sarvanamasthana_ affix follows". Thus चत्वा꣡रः, अनड्वा꣡हः, here the augment-accent supersedes the accent of the stem, for च꣡तुर was acutely accented on the first syllable, so also अनडु꣡ह्, these being formed by the affixes उरन् and असुन् respectively. Thus चत् + उरन् = च꣡तुर (चतेरुरन् _Un_ V. 58, accent (VI. 1. 197)); अनडुह् is thus derived : अनो वहति = अनस् + वह् + क्विप्, the स् is replaced by ड्, and there is vocalisation of व् of वह् (VI. I. 15) = अनडु꣡ह् ॥ This word is formed by a _Krit_ affix with a _karaka_ _upapada_, therefore, the second term will retain its original accent, namely the final acute of a root. (VI. 1. 162) and (VI. 2. 139) अनस् itself is derived by adding the affix (_Un_ IV. 189) असुन् which makes the word acutely accented on the first syllable. (2). Similarly as to विकार (_Vikarana_):- (VII. 1. 75) teaches "instead of अस्थि, दधि, सक्थि, and अक्षि, there shall be आनङ् acutely accented when टा follows or any of the subsequent terminations beginning with a vowel". This अन will supersede the acute accent of the first अ of the stem: as अस्थ꣡नि ॥ The word अ꣡स्थि is derived from अस् by adding the affix क्थिन् (_Un_ III. 154) which makes the word acutely accented on the first (VI. 1. 197). This is an example of विकार ॥ (3) Similarly in गोपायति the accent of the stem taught in (VI. 1. 162) 'a root has an accent on its final', supersedes the accent of the _vikarana_ आय (III. 1. 28), (III. 1. 3), i. e. the acute accent on आ in आय gives way to the root-accent which makes य acute. (4) So also the accent of the affix supersedes that of the stem : as कर्त्तव्य॑म्, and हर्तव्य॑म्, which are formed by the affix तव्यत् (III. 1. 96) here (VI. 1. 185) debars the accent of the root (VI. 1. 162).

The determination of the proper accent of a word depends upon considering the various rules that have gone to form it, and the sequence of those rules, e. g. a latter rule (पर) superseding a prior rule, a _nitya_ rule superseding an _anitya_ rule, an _antaranga_ superseding a _bahiranga_, an _apavada_ rule superseding an _utsarga_ rule. But another test is, what is the remaining rule that applies after giving scope to all. A rule, that in spite of another rule, finds scope or activity, bars that former rule. Thus गोपायति ॥ It is derived from गु꣡प् root, which as a root has accent on the syllable गु (VI. 1. 162). When the affix आय is added to it by (III. 1. 28), the word becomes गोपा꣡य and it takes the accent of the affix (III. 1. 3), i. e. the accent now falls on पा; but now comes rule (III. 1. 32) which says that a word taking the affix आय is a root. Thus गोपाय꣡ gets the designation of root (धातु), and thus takes the accent of a _dhatu_ (VI. 1. 162), and the accent falls on य ॥

The rule is that except one special accent taught in a _sutra_ the other syllables take _anudatta_. Therefore, where there is a conflict of rules, the accent is guided by the follwing maxim: "परनित्यान्तरङ्गापवादैः स्वरैर्व्यवस्था सति प्रकृतिशिष्ठेन च" namely (1) the sequence, a succeeding rule setting aside a prior rule (2) a _Nitya_ rule is stronger then _Anitya_, (3) _Antaranga_ stronger than _Bahiranga_, ( 4 ) the _Apavada_ is stronger then _Utsarga_. When all these are exhausted, as we have illustrated above, then we apply the rule of सतिशिष्ठ ॥ What is this rule? To quote the words of _Kasika_: यो हि यस्मिन् सति शिष्यते स तस्य बाधको भवति "that which does remain and must last in spite of the presence of another, debars such other". Thus in गोपायति; here the प्रत्ययस्वरः "the accent of the affix" (III. 1. 3) by which the acute is on the first syllable of the affix is an _apavada_ to the धातुस्वरः (VI. 1. 192) by which the final of a _dhatu_ is acute, and it debars the _dhatu_-accent; but this affix-accent is in its turn debarred in the case of derivative verbs formed with affixes, by the rule of सतिशिष्ठ, because even after the addition of the affix, these words retain the designation of _dhatu_. Similarly in कार्ष्णोत्तरासङ्गपुत्रः, "The son of him whose upper garment (_uttarasanga_) is of black color--the Son of _Baladeva_" the _Bahuvrihi_-accent (VI. 2. 1) being an _apavada_ to _Samasa_-accent (VI. 1. 223), debars the _samasa_-accent; but this _Bahuvrihi_-accent is in its turn debarred by the rule of सतिशिष्ठ when a further compound is formed and the final word is a compound only and not a _Bahuvrihi_. Though the accent of the _Vikarana_ is a सतिशिष्ठ, yet it does not debar the _Sarvadhatuka_ accent (VI. 1. 186). Thus in लुनीतः, the accent of the _vikarana_ नी does not debar the accent of तस् ॥

Vart:- The नञ् accent is stronger than the case-affix accent. Thus in अतिस्रः, here the accent of जस् _vibhakti_ after तिसृ (VI. 1. 166) though सतिशिष्ठ is debarred by नञ् accent taught in (VI. 2. 2), for Negative compounds are _Tatpurusha_.

Vart:- The accent of नञ् is stronger than the accent of that which is caused or occasioned by a _vibhakti_. Thus अचत्वारः ॥  Here the augment आम् in चत्वार is occasioned because of the case-affix, for it is added only then when a _Sarvanama_ case-affix follows (VII. 1. 98). This आ is _udatta_ (VI. 1. 98). But this _udatta_ is superseded by the accent of the Negative particle.

Why do we say 'in the body of a _pada_'? In a sentence, every word will retain its accent. As देव꣡दत्त ! गा꣡मभ्याज शुक्ला꣡म् "_O_ _Devadatta_, drive away the white cow". The word पद is in fact used in this _sutra_ in its secondary sense, namely that which will get the designation of पद when completed; had it meant the full ready made _pada_, this word would not have been repeated in पदाधिकार _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 16), (VIII. 1. 17). Had a full '_pada_' been meant, the incongruity would arise in the following. The word कु꣡वल is acutely accented on the first as belonging to ग्रामादि class (_Phit_ II. 15), adding the feminine affix ङीष् to it by its belonging to ग्रामादि class, we get कुवली, which will retain its acute on the first because it is not technically a पद ॥ But it is not so, the word कुवली has _anudatta_ accent on the first syllable (_Phit_ II. 15), and hence we can apply the अञ् affix to it by (IV. 2. 44), thus कुवल्या विकारः = कौवलम् ॥ Similarly the word गर्भिणी formed from ग꣡र्भ (belonging to _Gramadi_ class _Phit_ II. 15), with, the affix इनि (V. 2. 115) and the feminine ङीप् ॥ If here the affix इनि being _udatta_ causes all the rest syllables _anudatta_, just at the very moment of its application, without seeing whether the word was a _pada_ or not, then the word गर्भिणी being _anudattadi_ would have taken अञ्, and therefore its exception is proper in the भिक्षादि class (IV. 2. 38). But if the _anudatta_-hood of the remaining syllables were to follow after a word had got the designation of पद, then the word गर्भिणी would remain acutely accented on the first, and its enumeration in (IV. 2. 38) would be useless.
