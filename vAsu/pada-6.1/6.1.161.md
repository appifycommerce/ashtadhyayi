sutra: अनुदात्तस्य च यत्रोदात्तलोपः
vRtti: उदात्त इति वर्त्तते । यस्मिन्ननुदात्ते परत उदात्तो लुप्यते तस्यानुदात्तस्यादिरुदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: An unaccented vowel gets also the acute accent, when on account of it the preceding acute is elided.

The word _udatta_ is understood here. Thus कुमार꣡ + ई॒ = कुमा॒री꣡ ॥ The word कुमार has acute on the last, when the unaccented (_anudatta_) ङीप् is added to it, the अ꣡ is elided (6.1.148), the _anudatta_ ई॒ becomes _udatta_. So also प॒थिन्꣡ + श॒स् = प॒थः꣡ (7.1.88), प॒थिन् + ए॒ = प॒थे, प॒थिन् + आ॒ = प॒था꣡ ॥ The पथिन् has acute on the last. So also कुमुद + ड्मतुप् = कुमुद्वा꣡न् (4.2.87), न॒ड्व꣡त्, वे॒तस्वत् ॥ The words कुमुद &c, are end-acute, and the affix मत् (वत्) is _anudatta_ (3.1.4).

Why 'an _anudatta_ vowel gets &c'. Observe प्रा॒सङ्गः + य॑त् = प्रासङ्ग्यः ॥ (प्रासङ्गं वहति (4.4.76)). Here though प्रसङ्ग꣡ is end-acute (6.2.144) formed by घञ् with __gati_)) it is followed by य॑ which is _svarita_ (6.1.185), this _svarita_ causes the _lopa_ of अ꣡ _udatta_: but it does not itself become _udatta_. No, this is not a proper counter-example. For by the general rule of accent (6.1.158), when one syllable is ordained to be _udatta_ or _svarita_, all the other syllables of that word become _anudatta_. Therefore when य॑ is taught to be _svarita_, all the other syllables (like ङ्ग꣡) will become _anudatta_. So there is no _lopa_ of _udatta_ when य॑ comes. The word अनुदात्त is used to indicate that the initial _anudatta_ becomes _udatta_. Had _anudatta_ not been used, the _sutra_ would have been यत्रोदात्तलोपश्च, which would mean यस्मिन् प्रत्यये परत; उदात्तालुप्यते तस्यान्त उदात्तो भवति, for the _anuvritti_ of अन्त would then be read from the last. There would then be anomaly in the case of मा हि धुक्षाताम्, and माहि धुक्षाथाम् ॥ From the root दुह we have formed धुक्षाताम् and धुक्षाथाम् in the Aorist Atmanepada_, dual. दुह् + क्स꣡ + आताम् = दुह् + स् (7.3.72) + आताम् ॥ Here आताम् causes the elision of the _udatta_ अ of स ॥ Therefore the final of आता꣡म् would be _udatta_, which is not desired. The augment अ is not added because of मा, had it been added, the अ꣡ would have been _udatta_ (6.4.71). Had हि not been given, then also the whole of धुक्षाताम् would have become _anudatta_ in माधुक्षाताम् because of तिङ्ङतिङः (8.1.28). See (8.1.34) (हि च). Why have we used the word यत्र in the _sutra_? If it was not employed, then the subsequent _anudatta_ may be such which would not have caused the elision of the previous _udatta_; such _udatta_ being elided by some other operator, and still such _anudatta_ would have become _udatta_. Thus in भार्गवः, भार्गवौ, भृगवः ॥ Here भृगवः is plural of भार्गवः ॥ The word भार्गव is end-acute and this acute (अण्) was elided in the plural, before the affix जस् was added. The elision here is not caused by जस्, but is a subject of जस् (not निमित्त but विषय). Therefore जस् does not become _udatta_, which would have been the case, had यत्र not been used. प्राक् सुबुत्पत्ते गोत्रप्रत्ययस्य लुक् ॥ The _gotra_ affix was elided prior to the adding of the case-ending. Why do we say "when an _udatta_ is elided"? Observe बिद + अञ् (4.1.104) = ब꣡द ॥ The feminine of this will be बैद꣡ + ङीन् (4.1.73) = बैदी꣡ ॥ Here ई causes the elision of _anudatta_ अ of द, and hence remains unchanged. So also आ꣡ र्वी ॥
