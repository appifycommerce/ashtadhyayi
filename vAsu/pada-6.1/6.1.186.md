sutra: तास्यनुदात्तेन्ङिददुपदेशाल्लसार्वधातुकमनुदात्तमह्न्विङोः
vRtti: तासेरनुदात्तेतोङितोऽकारान्तोपदेशाच्च शब्दात्परं लसार्वधातुकमनुदात्तं च भवति हुङ् इङ् इत्यताभ्यां परं वर्जयित्वा ॥
vRtti_eng: The Personal-endings and their substitutes (III. 2. 124) – (III. 2. 126) are, when they are _sarvadhatuka_ (III. 4. 113) &c)), unaccented, after the characteristic of the Periphrastic future (तासि), after a root which in the _Dhatupatha_ has an unaccented vowel or a ङ् (with the exception of ह्नुङ् and इङ्) as indicatory letter, as well as after what has a final अ in the Grammatical system of Instruction (_upadesa_).

Thus तासि :- कर्त्ता, कर्त्तारौ, कर्त्तारः, this debars the affix accent (III. I. 3). _Anudattet_ :-as, आस् - आस्ते, वस् - वस्ते ॥ डित् :- षूङ् - सूते, शीङ् - शेते ॥ अत् उपदेशः :- as तुदतः, नुदतः, पचतः, पठतः ॥ A root taking शप् (अ) is considered as taught (_upadesa_) as if ending with an अ, as the indicatory letters श् and प् are disregarded on the maxim अनुबन्धस्यानैकान्तिकत्वं (= अनवयवत्वं) ॥ Thus पचमानः, यजमानः ॥ The augment मुक is added by आने मुक् (VII. 2. 82) which may be explained in two ways; first, the augment मुक् is added to the final अ of the base (_anga_) when आन (आनच् &c) follows; or secondly, the the augment मुक् is added to the base (_anga_) which ends in अ, when आन follows. In the first case मुक् becomes part and parcel of अ and will be taken and included by the enunciation of अ, and therefore अदुपदेश will mean and include an अ having such मुक्, as on the maxim यदागमास्तद्गुणीभूतास्तद्ग्रहणेन गृह्यन्ते "That to which an augment is added denotes, because the augment forms part of it, not merely itself, but it denotes also whatever results from its combination with that augment". Therefore मुक् will not prevent the verb becoming अदुपदेश ॥ But if secondly मुक् be taken as part of the base which ends in अ, then the लसार्वधातुक does not follow an अदुपदेश, because म intervenes. But we get rid of this difficulty by considering मुक् augment as _Bahiranga_ and therefore _asiddha_, when the _Antaranga_ operation of accent is to be performed. The augment मुक् (म्) in the last two examples consequently does not prevent the application of the rule. Though the affix शानच् has an indicatory च्, yet चित् accent (VI. 1. 163) is debarred by this rule, as it is subsequent.

Why do we say after तासि &c. Observe चिनुतः चिन्वन्तिः ॥ The _vikarana_ श्नु is ङित् (I. 2. 4) with regard to operations affecting the prior term, and not those which affect the subsequent. Therefore though श्नु is considered as ङित् for the purposes of preventing the _guna_ of the prior term चि, it will not be considered so for the purposes of subsequent accent. Or the word ङित् in this _sutra_ may be taken as equal to ङिदुपदेश and not the आतिदेशिक ङित् like श्नु ॥ Why do we use the word _upadesa_ ? So that the rule may apply to पचावः, पचामः, but not to हतः, हथः the dual of हन् which ends in न् in _upadesa_. though before तस् and थस् it has assumed the form ह ॥ Therefore हतः, हथः ॥ Why do we use the word ल (Personal endings)? Observe कतीह पचमाना formed by शानन् added to पू (III. 2. 128), which not being a substitute of लट्, is not a personal ending like शानच् ॥ Why do we use the word _Sarvadhatuka_ ? Observe, शिश्ये, शिश्यति, शिश्यिरे ॥ Why do we say with the exception of ह्नुङ् and इङ् ? Observe ह्नुते, यद् अधीते ॥
