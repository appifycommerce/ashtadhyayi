sutra: आदिः सिचोऽन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: उदात्त इति वर्त्तते । सिजन्तस्यान्यतरस्यामादिरुदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "In सिच् Aorist, the first syllable may optionally have the acute accent."
---   
The word उदात्त is understood here. Thus मा हि कार्ष्टाम्, मा हि कार्ष्टाम्; मा हि लाविष्टाम् or मा हि लाविष्टाम् ॥ In the last example the accent is on पि; and the reason why मा and हि are used in these illustrations, has already been explained in (VI. I. 161). The indicatory च् of सिच् the shows that by (VI. 1. 163) the acute will be on the otherwise unaccented augment इट्, when it takes this augment. The सिच् being a वलादि affix will take the augment इट् (VII. 2. 35), and it is a general rule that augments are unaccented; so in the above the वि would have been unaccented, and the accent would have been on the final, but for the indicatory च् of सिच्, which otherwise would find no scope. Thus वि gets acute.

Vart:- An affix having an indicatory प् (पित्) when coming after an Aorist by सिच् without the augment इट् (अनिट् सिच्) is in one alternative _udatta_ (in the other, it is non-acute). This _vartika_ restricts the scope of the _sutra_ with regard to पित् affixes. Thus we get the following two forms, which otherwise would have one form only by _dhatu_-accent, namely, acute on the first, for पित् is _anudatta_. Thus माहि कार्षम् or मा हि कार्षम् ॥ But when it takes the
इट् augment, there are two forms (Ist.) मा हि लाविषम् as a तिङन्त, (2nd.) मा हि लाविषम् accent on वि(VI. 1. 163). but never मा हि लाविषम् ॥ When however the augment अ is added, the accent falls on this augment (VI. 4. 71).
