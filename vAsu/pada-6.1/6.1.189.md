sutra: अभ्यस्तानामादिः
vRtti: अभ्यस्तानामजादावनिटि लसार्वधातुके परत आदिरुदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The acute accent falls on the first syllable of the reduplicate verbs when followed by an affix beginning with a vowel (the vowel being not इट्) and being a _sarvadhatuka_ personal ending."

Thus ददति, ददतु, दधति, दधतु, जक्षति, जक्षतुः, जाग्रति, जाग्रतुः ॥ Before consonant affixes: दद्यात् ॥ Before सेट् affixes :- जक्षितः ॥ Though the word आदि was understood here from the last aphorism, the repetition is for the sake of making this an invariable rule and not an optional rule as those in the foregoing.
