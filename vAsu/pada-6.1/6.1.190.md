sutra: अनुदात्ते च
vRtti: अविद्यमानोदात्ते च लसार्वधातुके परतोऽभ्यस्तानामादिरुदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Also when the unaccented endings of the three persons in the singular follow, the first syllable of the reduplicate has the acute.
---   
The endings तिप् सिप् and मिप् are _anudatta_ (III. 1. 4). This _sutra_ applies to those personal endings which do not begin with a vowel. Thus ददाति, जहाति, दधाति, जिहीते, मिमीते ॥ The word अनुदात्त is to be construed here as a _Bahuvrihi_ i. e. an affix in which there is no _udatta_ vowel, so that the rule may apply when a portion of the affix is elided or a semivowel is substituted : as मा हि दधात्, and दधात्यत्र ॥
