sutra: थलि च सेटीडन्तो वा
vRtti: सेटि थलि इट वा उदात्तो भवति अन्तो वा आदिर्वाऽन्यतरस्याम् ॥
vRtti_eng: "Before the ending थ of the Perfect, second person singular, when this ending takes the angment इ; this acute accent falls either on the first syllable, or on this इ, or on the personal ending."
---   
Thus लु꣡लविथ, लुल꣡विथ, लुलविथ꣡, and लुलविथ꣡. As थल् has an indicatory ल्, the syllable preceding the affix may have also the accent (VI. 1. 193). Thus we get the four forms given above. In short, with इथ termination, the accent may fall on any syllable. When the थ is not सेट्, the accent falls on the root and we have one form only by लिट् accent (VI. 1. 193) :- ययाथ ॥
