sutra: ञ्नित्यादिर्नित्यम्
vRtti: ञिति निति च नित्यमादिरुदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "Whatever is derived with an affix having an indicatory ञ or ण्, has the acute accent invariably on the first syllable."

Thus गा꣡र्ग्य with यञ् (IV. I. 105), वा꣡सुदेवकः, अ꣡र्जुनकः with थुन् (IV. 3. 98). This is an exception to (III. 1. 3). When the affixes are, however, elided, the word loses this accent, i. e. the affix does not leave its mark behind, as it generally does by (I. 1. 62). Therefore गर्गाः꣡, बिदाः꣡, चञ्चाः꣡ having lost यञ्, अञ् and कन्, have lost their accent also.
