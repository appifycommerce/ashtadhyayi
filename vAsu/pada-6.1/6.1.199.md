sutra: पथिमथोः सर्वनामस्थाने
vRtti: पथिमथिशब्दावौणादिकाविनिप्रत्ययान्तौ प्रत्ययस्वरेणान्तोदात्तौ तयोः सर्वनामस्थाने परत आदिरुदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The acute accent is on the first syllable of पथिन् and मथिन् when followed by a strong case-ending.

The words पथिन् and मथिन् are derived by the _Unadi_ affix इनि, (IV. 12. and 13) and are oxytone by (3.1.3). They become _adyudatta_ before strong cases. Thus प꣡न्थाः, प꣡न्थानौ, प꣡न्थानः, म꣡न्थाः, म꣡न्थानौ, म꣡न्थानः ॥ Before other cases we have:- पथः꣡ पश्य, मथः꣡ पश्य ॥ The accent is on the final by (6.1.162), there being elision of the _udatta_ इन् ॥ The rule (1.1.62), about the remaining effect of the affix, does not apply here. As पथि꣡प्रियः, has acute on the final of the first word, by retaining its original accent.
