sutra: अन्तश्च तवै युगपत्
vRtti: तवैप्रत्ययान्तस्यान्तश्चशब्दादिश्च युगपदुदात्तौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The Infinitive in तवै has the acute on the first syllable and on the last syllable at one and the same time."

Thus क꣡र्तवै꣡, ह꣡र्तवै꣡ ॥ This is an exception to (III. 1. 3) by which त of तवै ought to have got the accent, and it also countermands rule (VI. 1. 158) by which there can be only a single acute in a single word.
