sutra: आशितः कर्ता
vRtti: आशितशब्दः कर्तृवाची आद्युदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word आशित meaning \"having eaten\" has acute on the first syllable.
---   
Thus आशितो देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_, having eaten'. Here it is used as an active participle. The क्त is added to अश् preceded by आ, to form both Active and Passive Participles : which by (VI. 2. 144) would have taken acute on the final. This debars that. In the Passive Participle we have आशितम् देवदत्तेन 'eaten by _Devadatta_'. आशितमन्नम् 'the eaten food'. The former is भावे क्त, the second is कर्मणि क्त ॥
