sutra: चायः की
vRtti: यङीति वर्त्तते । चयि पूजानिशामनयोरित्येतस्य धातोर्यङि परतः कीत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The verb की is substituted for the verb चायृ 'to worship, to observe', when the Intensive affix यङ् follows.

The phrase यङि is understood here. Thus चेकीयते, चेकीयेते, चेकीयन्ते ॥ The exhibition of की in the _sutra_ with a long ई indicates that there is long vowel even in tenses where यङ् is elided, as चेकीतः ॥ For if the _sutra_ had enunciated कि with a short इ as the substitute of चाय्, the forms चेकीयते &c would have been still valid. Thus कि + यङ् = चि + कि + य = चे + कि + य = चे + की + य (VII. 4. 25) causing the lengthening of the short इ). But then the _Nishtha_ would have been चेकितः which is wrong.
