sutra: चङ्यन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: चङन्तेऽन्यतरस्यामुपोत्तममुदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The acute accent may be optionally on the penultimate syllable of the reduplicated Aorist in चङ्, the word consisting of more than two syllables.

Thus मा हि चीकर꣡ताम् or चीक꣡रताम् ॥ The augment अट् is elided by the addition of मा, (VI. 4. 74); हि prevents the verb from becoming _anudatta_ (VIII. 1. 34) then comes the चित् accent of चङ् ॥ The augmented form with अट् has acute always on the first syllable (VI. 4. 71). When the word is of less than three syllables, the rule does not apply, as, माहि दध꣡त् ॥
