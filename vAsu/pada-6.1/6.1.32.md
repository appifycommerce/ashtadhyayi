sutra: ह्वः संप्रसारणम्
vRtti: णौ च संश्चङोरिति वर्त्तते । सन्परे चङ् परे च णौ परतो ह्वः संप्रसारणं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "There is the vocalisation of the semivowel of the causative of _hve_ (ह्वे) before the Desiderative and the Reduplicated Aorist affixes."
---
The whole of the last _sutra_ is to be read into this _sutra_. Thus जुहावयिषति and जुहावयिषतः; जुहावयिषन्ति; अजूहवत्, अजूहवताम् and अजूहवन् ॥ The root ह्वा does not take the augment य required by (VII. 3. 37) before the affix णि, because the _Samprasarana_ rule is stronger. The repetition of the word संप्रसारण in this _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ was present, indicates that the force of the word विभाषा has ceased. Though this and the next _sutra_ could well have been made one, their separation shows that the _samprasarana_ does not take place when another affix, not causing reduplication, intervenes. As ह्वायकमिच्छति = ह्वायकीयति; the Desiderative of this verb is जिह्वायकीयिषति ॥
