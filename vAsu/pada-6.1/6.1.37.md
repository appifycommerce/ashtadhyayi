sutra: न संप्रसारणे संप्रसारणम्
vRtti: संप्रसारणे परतः पूर्वस्य यणः संप्रसारणं न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When a semivowel has been once vocalised, there is no vocalisation of the other semivowel that may precede it in the same word.

---
Thus व्यध्; has two semi-vowels व् and य्; when य् is once vocalised into इ, the preceding व will not be vocalised into उ ॥ Thus we have विद्धः ॥ From व्यच् – विचितः, व्येञ् – संवीतः ॥ Though the rule of vocalisation does not specify what particular semivowel is to be vocalised, yet according to the maxim that the operation is to be performed on the letter nearest to the operator, the second semivowel in the above cases is vocalised and the first is not, by force of this rule. Had the first semi-vowel been vocalised, then there would be no scope for this _sutra_, because then no semi-vowel will be found preceding a vocalised letter. This _sutra_ is a _jnapaka_ that the vocalisation commences with the second of the conjunct semi-vowels.

Though the _anuvritti_ of संप्रसारण was understood here, the repetition of this word shows that the prohibition of double vocalisation in the same word applies even when the semivowels are not contiguous. Thus by (6.1.133) there is vocalisation of the word युवन्, the व being changed to उ, the य is not changed as यूना ॥ It might be objected that when the उ of यु, and उ the _samprasarana_ of व coalesce into one by _sandhi_ rules, then there being the substitution of one long ऊ for the two उ’s and this is _sthanivat_ to the original, the य  and व् of युवन् should be considered in fact as contiguous and not separated by an intervening letter, and therefore, the explanation given above does not hold good; we reply. The substitution of one long vowel for two vowels, is not considered _sthanivat_ (See (l. 1.58)). Even though it be considered as _sthanivat_, it is still a separating letter.

Vart:- There is vocalisation of the semivowel of त्रि when followed by ऋच्, and there is elision of the ऋ of ऋच्, when it refers to Metres. As तिस्र ॠचो यस्मिन् = तृचं सुक्तं ॥ तृचं साम ॥ The word तृच् takes the _samasanta_ affix अ by (5.4.74). Why do we say when referring to a metre? Observe त्यृचं कर्म ॥

Vart:- In the _Chhandas_ there is diversely vocalisation of the semi-vowel of रयि followed by the affix मतुप् as रयि + मत् = रइ + मत् = र + इ + मत् = र + इ + वत् (8.2.15) = रवेत्; as, आ रेवानेतु नो विशः ॥ Sometimes it does not take place, as रयिमान् पुष्टिवर्द्धनः ॥ The म here is not changed to व as required by (8.2.15).

Vart:- There is vocalisation of कक्ष्या before मत् when a Name is meant: as कक्षीवन्तं य औशिजः ॥ This _Vartika_ is unnecessary. See (8.2.12) where the form कक्षीवत् is given.
