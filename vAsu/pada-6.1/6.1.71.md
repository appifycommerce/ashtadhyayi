sutra: पिति कृति परतो ह्रस्वस्य तुगागमो भवति ॥
vRtti: ह्रस्वस्य पिति कृति तुक्
vRtti_eng: To a root ending in a short vowel is added the augment तू (तुक्) when a _Krit_-affix having an indicatory प् follows.

Thus अग्नि + चि + क्विप् = अग्निचित्, so also सोमसुत् ॥ Similarly प्रकृत्य and प्रहृत्य and उपस्तुत्य formed by the affix ल्यप् ॥ Why do we say "ending in a short vowel"? Observe आलूय, ग्रामणीः ॥ Why do we say "having an indicatory प"? Observe कूतम्, हृतम् ॥ Why do we say "a _krit_ affix"? Observe पटुतरः, पटुतमः, with the _Taddhita_-affixes तरप् and तमप् ॥ In the compound ग्रामणिकुलम्, though the root is made short, yet there is no augment तुक्, in as much as the rule by which the root has been shortened is a _Bahiranga_ rule, and the present rule is an _Antaranga_ one. The maxim is असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे ॥ "That which is _Bahiranga_ is regarded as not having taken effect, or as not existing, when that which is _Antaranga_ is to take effect".
