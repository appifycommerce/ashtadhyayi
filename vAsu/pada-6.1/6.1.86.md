sutra: षत्वतुकोरसिद्धः
vRtti: षत्वे तुकि च कर्तव्ये एकादेशोऽसिद्धो भवति, सिद्धकार्यं न करोतीत्यर्थः ॥
vRtti_eng: The substitution of a single _adesa_ is to be considered as to have not taken effect, when otherwise स would have to be changed to ष, or when the augment त् (तुक्) is to be added.

The word असिद्ध means not-accomplished i. e. the operation caused by its having taken effect is not produced. The word _asiddha_ always debars operations dependent upon this _adesa_, and gives scope to the operations dependent upon the general rule ( असिद्धवचनमादेशलक्षणप्रतिषेदार्थमुत्संगलक्षणभावार्थं च ॥) Thus कांऽसिचत् here स is not changed to ष ॥ The equation is thus exhibited : कस् + असिचत् = कर् + असिचत् (the स changed to र by (VIII.2.66)) कंउ + असिचत् (उ being substituted for र by (VI.1.113)) = को + असिचत् (अ + उ = ओ (VI.1.87))  = कोऽसिचत् (ओ + अ = ओ (VI.1.109)). Now applies our _sutra_. By (VIII.3.59), स coming after ओ required to be changed into ष, but here the single-substitute ओ is considered to be non-effective for this purpose. Similarly कोऽस्य, योऽस्य, कोऽस्मै, यौऽस्मै ॥ Similarly in अधीत्य there is the addition of त् by (VI.1.71), though actually preceded by a long vowel. That long vowel had resulted from the _ekadesa_ of ई for इ + इ, and this _ekadesa_ is considered as if non-effective for the purposes of तुक् augment. Similarly in प्र + इ + तुक् + य = प्रेत्य. Here also अ + इ = ए is considered _asiddha_.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of _samprasarana_, the Locative singular case-ending is ङि (इ), and the Ist person singular _Atmanepada_ affix इट् ॥ Of vocalisation we have the following : शकहूष् = शकान् ह्वयति, then we add क्विप्, before which there is vocalisation of व्, this उ combining with in the following आ becomes उ _ekadesa_: as शकहा + क्विप् = शकह्उआ + ० (VI. I. I5) + शकहु (VI. I. 108). The Locative plural is formed by सु : शकहु + सु = शकहूषु (the lengthening taking place by (VI.4.2)). Here स is changed to ष the _ekadesa_ उ for उ + अ not being considered _asiddha_. So also परिवीषु (परि + ष्ये + क्विप् = परि + व्इए + क्विप् = परिवि, add सु)॥ Of the affix ङि we have:- वृक्ष + इ = वृक्षे, add छत्रम्, then the single substitute ए being considered not _asiddha_ we have वृक्षेच्छत्रम् or वृक्षेछत्रम् ॥ Of the affix इट् of Ist Person _Atmanepada_ we have अपचे + छत्रम् = अपचेच्छत्रम् or अपचेछत्रम् ॥  In both these cases we optionally add तुक् by (VI. I. 75) - (VI. I. 76), by considering the _ekadesa_ (VI.1.87) as to have taken effect, and making the finals दीर्घ or long. Here the _ekadesa_ is not _asiddha_ and therefore तुक् is optional and not compulsory.
