sutra: बहुव्रीहौ प्रकृत्या पूर्वपदम्
vRtti: पूर्वपदग्रहणमत्र पूर्वपदस्थे स्वरे उदात्ते स्वरिते वा वर्त्तते । बहुव्रीहौ समासे पूर्वपदस्य यः स्वरः स प्रकत्या भवति, स्वभावेनावतिष्ठते, न विकारमनुदात्तत्वमापद्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: "In a _Bahuvrihi_, the first member preserves its own original accent."
---
The word पूर्वपदम् means here the accent-whether _udatta_ or _svarita_ - which is in the first member: प्रकृत्या means, retains its own nature, does not become modified into an _anudatta_ accent. By the rule (VI. 1. 223), the final of a compound gets the accent, so that all the preceding members lose their accent and become _anudatta_, as in one word all syllables are unaccented except one. (VI. 5. 158). Thus the first member of a _Bahuvrihi_ would have lost its accent and become _anudatta_; with the present _sutra_ commences the exceptions to the rule that the final of a compound is always, _udatta_. Thus का꣡र्ष्णोत्तरासङ्गाः ॥ The word कार्ष्ण is derived by the _Taddhita_ affix अञ् (IV. 3. 154) from कृष्ण 'a kind of antelope;' and has the ञित् accent (VI. 1. 197) i. e. on the first syllable: which the word preserves in the compound also. So also यू꣡पवलजः; the word यूप is derived from  यु by the _Unadi_ affix प (_Unadi_ III. 27.), before which the vowel becomes lengthened (_Unadi_ III. 25) and the affix is treated as नित् (_Unadi_ III. 26), and hence the word is acutely accented on the first syllable (VI. 1. 197). So also ब्रह्मचारि꣡ परिस्कन्दः; the word ब्रह्मचारिन् has a _Krit_ formed word as its second part, and gets the acute on the final (VI. 2. 139). So also स्ना꣡तकपुत्रः, the word स्नातक is derived by कन् (V. 4. 29) affix and has नित् accent (VI. 1. 197) i. e. _udatta_ on the first syllable. So also अध्या꣡पकपुत्रः, the word अध्यापक is accented on the middle as it is formed by a लित् affix (III. 1. 133), (VI. 1. 193). श्रो꣡त्रियपुत्रः, the श्रोत्रिय being enounced with an indicatory न् in _Sutra_ (V. 2. 84) is acutely accented on the first. मनुष्य॑नाथः, the word मनुष्य being formed by यत् (IV. 1. 161) a तित् affix is _svarita_ (VI. 1. 185).

The words _udatta_ and _svarita_ are understood in this aphorism. Therefore if all the syllables of the _purvapada_ are _anudatta_, the present rule has no scope there, and such a compound will get _udatta_ on the final by the universal rule enunciated in (VI. 1. 223). Thus समभागः꣡, here सम being all _anudatta_, the accent falls on ग ॥
