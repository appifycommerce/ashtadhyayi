sutra: बहुव्रीहौ विश्वं संज्ञायाम्
vRtti: बहुव्रीहौ समासे विश्वशब्दः पूर्वपदं संज्ञायां विषयेऽन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word विश्व has acute on the final, being first member in a _Bahuvrihi_, when it is a Name.

Thus विश्व꣡देवः, विश्व꣡यशाः, विश्व꣡महान् ॥ This is an exception to (VI. 2. 1) by which the first member in a _Bahuvrihi_ would have retained its original accent. Why do we say in a _Bahuvrihi_ compound? Observe विश्वे च देवाः = विश्वदेवाः ॥ Why do we say 'when a name'? Observe विश्वेदेवा अस्य = विश्वदेवः ॥ But विश्वामित्रः꣡ and विश्वाजिनः꣡ have acute on the final, as they are governed by the subsequent rule (VI. 2. 165) which supersedes this. The word _Bahuvrihi_ governs the succeeding _sutras_ upto (VI. 2. 120) inclusive. The word विश्व is originally acute on the first, as it is formed by the affix क्वन् added to विश् ॥ This rule has unrestricted scope in विश्वदेवः, विश्वयशाः and rule (VI. 2. 165) has unrestricted scope in कुलमित्रः, कुलजिनः ॥ But in विश्वामित्रः and विश्वाजिनः there is a conflict, as both these rules would apply, therefore by the maxim of _vipratishedha_, (VI. 2. 165) supersedes this.
