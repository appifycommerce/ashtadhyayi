Thus वृको꣡दरः, दामो꣡दरः, हर्य॑श्वः, यौवना꣡श्वः, सुवर्णपुङ्खे꣡षुः and महेषुः꣡ ॥ This _sutra_ is also an exception to (VI. 2. 1) by which the first term would have retained its original accent. The word वृ꣡क has acute on the first by _Phit_ II .7. The word दा꣡म is formed by मनिन् affix (_Unadi_ IV. 145) and is first acute; ह꣡रि is also first acute as formed by इन् (_Unadi_ IV. 118). The word यौवन if considered as an underived primitive, has acute on the first by _Phit_ II. 19. If it be considered as derived from युवन् with the affix अण् then it is already end-acute and would retain its accent even by (VI. 2. 1). The first _Bahuvrihi_ word सुवर्ण has acute on the final by (VI. 2. 172), the second _Bahuvrihi_ compound सुवर्णपुंखाः has acute on र्ण by (VI. 2. 1), the third _Bahuvrihi_ with इषु gets accent on ख ॥ The word महत is end-acute by (V. 2. 38). Its mention here appears redundant.
