Thus कुण्डो꣡दरः, घटो꣡दरः, कटुका꣡श्वः, स्यन्दिता꣡श्वः, अनिघाते꣡षुः, चलाचले꣡षुः ॥ The word कु꣡ण्ड has acute on the first as it is a Neuter name (_Phit_ 11. 3), and it would have retained this accent in the _Bahuvrihi_ by (VI. 2. 1). but for this _sutra_. The word घट is formed by अच् (III. 1. 134) and has acute on the final, and so it would have retained this accent by (VI. 2. 1), even with out this _sutra_. The word क꣡टुक being formed by कन् (V. 3. 75) has acute on the first. स्यन्दित is formed by the _Nishita_ affix क्त ॥ The word अनिघात being an _avyayibhava_, the first member would have retained its original accent. In this and the last _sutra_, all the acutes may optionally be changed into _svarita_ by (VIII. 2. 6). But अनुदरः꣡ and सूदरः꣡ have acute on the final by (VI. 2. 172), which being a subsequent _sutra_, supersedes this present, so far as अन् and सु are concerned.
