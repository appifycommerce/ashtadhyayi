Thus पितृ꣡सदृशः, मातृ꣡सदृशः ॥ The words पितृ and मातृ are formed by _Unadi_ affix तृच् (_Unadi_ II. 95) and are finally accented. By (II. 1. 31), सदृश forms Instrumental _Tatpurusha_. That case, however, is governed by (VI. 2. 2), which provides for Instrumental compounds. The examples here given are of Genitive _Tatpurusha_: and it applies to cases where the case-ending is not elided. As दास्याः꣡ सदृशो, वृषल्या꣡ सदृशः ॥ Here दासी and वृषली are finally acute, and the case-affix gets the accent when semivowel is substituted (VI. 1. 174). So also पितृ꣡प्रतिरूपः, मातृ꣡प्रतिरूपः ॥ Why do we say 'when meaning resemblance'? Observe परमसदृशः꣡, उत्तमसदृशः꣡ (VI. I. 223): here the sense of the compound is that of 'honor' and not 'resemblance'.
