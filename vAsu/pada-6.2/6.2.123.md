vRtti: शालाशब्दान्ते तत्पुरुषे समासे नपुंसकलिङ्गे उत्तरपदमाद्युदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word शाला at the end of a _Tatpurusha_ compound when exhibited in the Neuter has acute on the first syllable.

Thus ब्राह्मणशा꣡लम्, क्षत्रियशा꣡लम् ॥ The compound becomes Neuter by (II.4.25). Why do we say "in a _Tatpurusha_"? Observe दृढशाल ब्राह्मणकुलम् which is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound and therefore first member retains its accent (VI. 2. I), and as the first member is a _Nishtha_ word, it has acute on the final. Why do we say "the word शाला?" Observe ब्राह्मणसेनम् ॥ Why do we say 'in the Neuter'? Observe ब्राह्मणशाला ॥ Compare (VI.2.86).
