sutra: गन्तव्यपण्यं वाणिजे
vRtti: वाणिजशब्द उत्तरपदे तत्पुरुषे समासे गन्तव्यवाचि पण्यवाचि च पूर्वपदं प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Before the word वाणिज 'a trader', the first member of a _Tatpurusha_ preserves its accent, when it is a word specifying the place whither one has to go, or the ware in which one deals.

Thus मद्रवाणिजः, काश्मीरवाणिजः, गान्धारिवाणिजः = मद्रादिषु गत्वा व्यवहरन्ति 'the _Madra_-merchants i. e. who trade by going to _Madra_ &c' All these are Locative compounds. मद्र is derived by रक् affix (_Unadi_ II, 13) and is acutely accented on the last (VI. 1. 165). काश्मीर belongs to _Krshodaradi_ class (VI. 3. 109), and has acute either on the first or the second syllable. The word गान्धारि belongs to the _Kardamadi_ class, and is consequently acute on the first or the second (_Phit_ III. 10) In the sense of पण्य we have: गोवाणिजः 'a dealer in cows', अश्ववाणिजः &c. गौ is finally accented (_Unadi_ II. 67): and अश्व has acute on the first (_Unadi_ I. 151) the affix being क्वन् ॥

Why do we say 'the place whither one goes, or the goods in which one deals?' Observe परमवाणिजः, उत्तमवणिजः ॥
