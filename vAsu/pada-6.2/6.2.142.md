sutra: नोत्तरपदेऽनुदात्तादावपृथिवीरुद्रपूषमन्थिषु
vRtti: उत्तरपदेऽनुदात्तादौ पृथिवीरुद्रपूषमन्थिवर्जिते देवताद्वन्द्वे नोभे युगपत्प्रकृतिस्वरे भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: In a _Dvandva_ compound of the names of divinities, both members of the compound simultaneously do not retain their accent, when the first syllable of the second word is _anudatta_, with the exception of पृथिवी, रुद्र, पूषन्, and मन्थिन् ॥

Thus इन्द्राग्नी, इन्द्रवायू, the words _Agni_ and _Vayu_ have acute on the final. The word _uttarapada_ is repeated in the _sutra_, in order that it should be qualified by the word '_anudattadau_', which latter would otherwise have qualified _Dvandva_. The word "_anudattadau_" shows the scope of the prohibition and the injunction. Why do we say with the exception of '_prithivi_' &c? Observe द्यावापृथिव्यौ or व्यौ _dvyava_ has acute on the first, '_prithivi_' being formed by '_nish_', has acute on the final. सोमारुद्रौ, _Rudra_ is formed by '_rak_' affix (_Unadi_ II. 22.), and has acute on the final. इन्द्रापूषणौ, _Pushan_ has acute on the end. (_Unadi_ I. 159) शुक्रामन्थिनौ, the words _Sukra_ and _manthin_ have acute on the final.
