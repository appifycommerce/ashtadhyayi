sutra: कारकाद्दत्तश्रुतयोरेवाशिषि
vRtti: संज्ञायामिति वर्त्तते, क्त इति च । संज्ञायां विषये आशिषि गम्यमानायां कारकादुत्तरयोर्दत्तश्रुतयोरेव क्तान्तयोरन्त उदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The final of Past Participles दत्त and श्रुत alone has acute, in a compound denoting a Name and a benediction, the preceding word being a word standing in close relation to an action (_karaka_).

Thus देवा एनंदेयासुः = देवदत्तः, विष्णुरेवं श्रूयाद् = विष्णुश्रुतः ॥

Why do we say "of दत्त and श्रुत"? Observe देवपालितः (VI. 2. 48), which, though a Name, is not governed by (VI. 2. 146), and does not take acute on the final, for the present rule makes a restriction with regard to that rule even. So that where a Participle in क्त is preceded by a _karaka_, and the compound denotes a benediction and a Name, the accent is not on the final, as required by (VI. 2. 146), but such a word is governed by (VI. 2. 48), unless the Participle be _Datta_ and _sruta_, when the present rule applies. The word कारक indicates that the rule will not apply when a _gati_ or _upapada_ precedes. Why do we use 'एव (alone)'? So that the restriction should apply to '_karaka_', and not to '_Datta_' and '_Sruta_'. For the words '_Datta_' and '_Sruta_' will have acute on the final even after a non_karaka_ word. As संश्रूतः, विश्रूतः ॥ Why do we say 'when denoting benediction'? The rule will not apply where benediction is not meant. As देवैः खाता = देवखाता ॥ This rule applies to _Datta_ and _Sruta_ after a _karaka_-word, only when benediction is meant. It therefore does not apply to देवदत्त 'the name of _Arjuna_'s conch', as आहतोनदति देवदत्तः, which is governed by (VI. 2. 48).
