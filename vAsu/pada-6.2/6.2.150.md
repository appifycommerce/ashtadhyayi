vRtti_eng: After a _karaka_ as mentioned in (VI. 2. 148), the second member ending in the affix अन, and denoting an action in the Abstract or the object (i. e. having the senses of a Passive Adjective), has acute on the final.

Thus ओदनभोजनं꣡ सुखम्, पयपानं꣡ सुखम्, चन्दनप्रियङ्गुकालेपनं꣡ सुखम् ॥ All these are examples of भाव or Abstract Verbal Nouns. राजभोजनाः꣡ शालयः, राजाच्छादनानि꣡ वासांसि, are examples of कर्मवचन or Passive Adjectives. These are formed by ल्युट् under (III. 3. 116). For the _Sutra_ (III. 3. 116) may be explained by saying that (1) ल्युट् is applied when the _Upapada_ is in the objective case and _bhava_ is meant, (2) as well as when object is to be expressed. When the first explanation is taken, the above are examples of _Bhava_; when the second explanation is taken, they are examples pf _Karma_. Why do we say "ending in अन्"? Observe, हस्तहा॑र्यमुदश्चित् ॥ Why do we say "when expressing an action in the abstract (_bhava_), or an Object (_karma_)"? Observe दन्तधाव꣡नम्, here ल्युट् is added after an Instrumental _karaka_ (III. 3. 117). Why do we say "after a _karaka_"? Observe निदर्श꣡नम्, अवलेख꣡नम् ॥ In all the counter-examples, the second members retain their original accent.
