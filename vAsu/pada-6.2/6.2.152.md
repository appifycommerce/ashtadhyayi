sutra: सप्तम्याः पुण्यम्
vRtti: सप्तम्यन्तात्परं पुण्यमित्येतदुत्तरपदमन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The word पुण्य has acute on the final when preceded by a noun in the Locative case."

Thus अध्ययने पुण्यम् = अध्ययनपुण्य꣡म्, वेदपुण्य꣡म् ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 1. 40) by the process of splitting the _sutra_ (_yoga_-_vibhaga_), taking सप्तमी there as a full _sutra_, and शौण्डैः another. Here by (VI. 2. 2), the first member would have preserved its accent, the present _sutra_ supersedes that and ordains acute on the final. The word पुण्य is derived by the _Unadi_ affix यत् (_Unadi_ V. 15) and would have retained its natural accent (VI. 1. 213) and thus get acute on the first syllable by _krit_-accent. (VI. 2. 139). Why do we say 'a locative case'? Observe वेदेन पुण्यं = वेदपुण्यम् ॥
