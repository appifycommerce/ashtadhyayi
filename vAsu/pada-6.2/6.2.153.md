sutra: ऊनार्थकलहं तृतीयायाः
vRtti: ऊनार्थान्युत्तरपदानि कलहशब्दश्च तृतीयान्तात्पराण्यन्तोदात्तानि भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The acute falls on the final of words having the sense of ऊन, and of कलह, when they are second members in a compound, preceded by a term in the instrumental case."

Thus माषोनम्, कार्षापणोनम्, मासविकलम्, कार्षापणविकलम्, असिकलहः, वाक्कलहः ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 1. 31). This is an exception to (VI. 2. 2) by which the first member being in the third case, would have retained its original accent, Some say that the word अर्थ in the _sutra_ means the word-form अर्थ, so that the aphorism would mean - "after an Instrumental case, the words ऊन, अर्थ, and कलह get acute on the final". The examples will be in addition to the above:- धान्येनार्थाः = धान्यार्थः ॥ If this be so, then the word-form ऊन alone will be taken and not its synonyms like विकल &c. To this we reply, that ऊन will denote its synonyms also, by the fact of its being followed by the word अर्थ ॥ By _sutra_ (II. 1. 31), ऊनार्थ and कलह (II. 1. 57) always take the Instrumental case, so we could have omitted the word तृतीयायाः, from this _sutra_, for by the maxim of _pratipadokta_ &c, ऊनार्थकलहं would have referred to the compound ordained by (II. 1. 31). The mention of तृतीया here is only for the sake of clearness.
