sutra: नञ्सुभ्याम्
vRtti: नञ्सुभ्यां परमुत्तरपदं बहुव्रीहौ समासेन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "A _Bahuvrihi_ formed by the Negative particle नञ् or by सु has acute on the last syllable of the compound."

Thus अयवो देशः, अव्रीहिः, अमाषः, सुयवः, सुव्रीहिः, सुमाषः ॥ The acute here rests on the last syllable of the completed compound; so that the rule applies to the compounds which have fully developed themselves by taking the _samasanta_ affixes. Thus अनृचः (formed by the _samasanta_ affix अ (V. 4. 74)). Though the word समास and उत्तरपद are both present here by context, yet the operation is performed on _samasa_. This is to be inferred, because of the next _sutra_. For had the present _sutra_ meant that the final of the second member (उत्तरपद) preceded by नञ् and सु gets the acute, then there would have been no necessity of the next _sutra_, for the present would have covered the case of सुकुमारीक &c because कप् is not a part of the second term (_uttarapada_) कुमारी but of the compound (_Samasa_) सुकुमारी; and therefore, if we translated the present _sutra_, by saying that the end of second term gets acute, the accent would have fallen on ई in सुकुमारीकः even by this _sutra_. But this is not intended, because of the accent of the _samasanta_ words अनृचः and बह्वृचः ॥ There is necessity of the next _sutra_, because a _samasa_ includes not only the simple _samasa_, but one ending with a _samasanta_ affix. Therefore, had not the next _sutra_ been made, the accent would have fallen on क and not on ई, for the affix कप् is considered part of the _samasa_ and not of the _uttarapada_ समासान्तः समासस्यैवावयवः नोत्तरपदस्य ॥
