sutra: बहोर्नञ्वदुत्तरपदभूम्नि
vRtti: उत्तरपदार्थबहुत्वे यो बहुशब्दो वर्त्तते तस्मान्नञ इव स्वरो भवति । नञ्सुभ्यामित्युक्तम् । बहोरपि तथा भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A _Bahuvrihi_ with बहु, has the same accent as नञ्, when it denotes muchness of the object expressed by the second member.

In other words a _Bahuvrihi_ with the word बहु in the first member, is governed by all those rules which apply to a _Bahuvrihi_ with a Negative Particle such as Rules (6.2.172) &c. when this gives the sense of multiety of the objects denoted by the second member. Thus बहुयवा꣡ देशः, बहुव्रीहिः꣡, बहुतिलः꣡ the same as (6.2.172). बहुय꣡वकः, बहुव्री꣡हिकः, बहुमा꣡षकः by (6.2.174). बहुज꣡रः, बहुम꣡रः, बहुमि꣡त्रः, बहुमृ꣡तः by (6.2.116): these examples of (6.2.116) are not given by Dr. Bohtlingk.

Why do we say '_uttara_-_pada_-_bhumni_-when multiety of the objects denoted by the second member is meant'? Observe बहुषु मनोऽस्य = बहु꣡मना अयम् (6.2.1).
