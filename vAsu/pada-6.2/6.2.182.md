Thus परिकूल꣡म्, परितीर꣡म्, परिमण्डल꣡म् ॥ This is a _Bahuvrihi_ or प्रादि compound or an _Avyayibhava_. If it is an _Avyayibhava_, then rule (VI.2.33) is superseded, and the first member does not retain its original accent. अभितः = उभयतः 'on both sides', अभितोभावोऽस्यास्ति = अभितोभाविन् 'that which has both sides': namely those things which have naturally two sides such as 'banks', 'shores' &c.
