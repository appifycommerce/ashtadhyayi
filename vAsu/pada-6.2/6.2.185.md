sutra: अभेर्मुखम्
vRtti: अभेरुत्तरं मुखमन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word मुख has acute on the final when preceded by अभि ॥

---
As, अभिमुख꣡म् ॥ It is a _Bahuvrihi_ or a प्रादि _samasa_. If it is an _Avyayibhava_, then it would have acute on the final by (VI.1.223) also. By (VI.2.177), even मुख would have oxytone after an _upasarga_, the present _sutra_ makes the additional declaration that मुख is oxytone even when the compound is not a _Bahuvrihi_, when it does not denote an indispensable part of body, or a part of body even, as was the case in (VI.2.177). Thus अभिमुखा꣡ शाला ॥
