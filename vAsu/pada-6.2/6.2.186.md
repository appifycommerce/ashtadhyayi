sutra: अपाच्च
vRtti: अपाच्चोत्तरं मुखमन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The word मुख has acute on the final, after the preposition अप् ॥"
---  
Thus अपमुखम्, अपमुखः ॥ The compound is in one case _Avyayibhava_ also, when rule (VI. 2. 33) will be superseded. The separation of this from the last _sutra_, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorism, in which the _anuvritti_ of अप only goes.
