sutra: अधेरुपरिस्थम्
vRtti: अधेरुत्तरमुपरिस्थवाचि अन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After अधि, that word, which denotes that thing which overlaps or stands upon, has acute on the final.

Thus अधिदन्तः = दन्तस्योपरि योऽन्योदन्तो जायते 'a tooth that grows over another tooth'.अधिकर्णः, अधिकेशः ॥ These are प्रादि _samasa_ or an appositional compound in which the second member has been dropped. Why do we say when meaning 'standing upon'? Observe अधिकरणम् Here the acute is on क, the _krit_-formed second member retaining its accent (VI. 2. 139).
