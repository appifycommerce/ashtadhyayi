sutra: अनोरप्रधानकनीयसी
vRtti: अनोरुत्तरमप्रधानवाचि कनीयश्चान्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After अनु, a word which is not the Principal, as well as कनीयस् has acute on the final.

The word अप्रधान means a word which stands in a dependant relation in a compound. Thus अनुगतो ज्येष्ठम् = अनुज्येष्ठः꣡, अनुमध्यमः꣡ ॥ These are प्रादि _samasa_ in which the first member is the principal or _Pradhana_. अनुगतः कनीयान् = अनुकनीया꣡म्, here the second member is the Principal: the word कनीयस् is taken as प्रधान ॥ Had it been non-_pradhana_, it would be covered by the first portion of the _sutra_, and there would have been no necessity of its separate enumeration. Why do we say "अप्रधान"? Observe अनुगतो ज्येष्ठः = अनुज्येष्ठः, where ज्येष्ठ is the Principal.
