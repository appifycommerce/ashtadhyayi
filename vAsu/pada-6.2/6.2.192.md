sutra: नेरनिधाने
vRtti: नेः परमुत्तरपदमन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After नि, the second member has the acute on the last syllable, when the sense is of 'not laying down'.
---  
The word निधानं = अप्रकाशता 'not making manifest'. Thus निमूलम्, न्यक्षम्, नितृणम् ॥ These are either _Bahuvrihi_ or _pradisamasa_. In the case of their being _Avyayibhava_, they would have acute on the final by (VI. 1. 223). Why do we say when meaning 'not laying down'? Observe निवाक् = निहितवाक् as निवाग्वृषलः; निदण्डः = निहितदण्डः ॥ The force of नि is that of निधान here.
