Thus (1) तु꣡ल्यश्वेतः, तु꣡ल्यलोहित, तु꣡ल्यमहान्, सदृ꣡क्च्छ्वेतः, सदृ꣡ग्लोहितः सदृ꣡ग्महान् ॥ These are _Karmadharaya_ compounds formed under (II. 1. 68): and तुल्य being formed by यत् is acutely accented on the first (VI. 1. 216). The word सदृक् is formed by क्विन् (III. 2. 60) _Vartika)), and has acute on the final (VI. 1. 197) and (VI. 2. 139). So also सदृ꣡शश्वेतः सदृ꣡शलोहितः, सदृ꣡शमहान् ॥ The word सदृश is formed by कञ् added to दृश्, and by (VI. I. 197) the accent falls on दृ (VI. 2. 139). (2) When the first member is in the Instrumental case, as :- शंकुलया खण्डः = शंकुला꣡खण्डः, so also किरिकाणः (II. I. 30) शंकुला is derived from शंकु + ला ॥ To the root ला is added the affix क with the force of घञ्, and thus the noun ला is _udatta_, or the whole word शंकुला is a word formed by क affix and hence (VI. 1. 165) applies and is final-acute. किरिः is formed by the _Unadi_ affix इ to कृ (_Unadi_ IV. 143), and it being treated as a कित् (_Unadi_. IV. 142) has _udatta_ on the final.

(3) When the first member is a word in the Locative case, as :- अक्षेषु शौण्डः = अक्ष꣡शौण्डः, so also पा꣡नशौण्डः ॥ The word अक्ष is formed by the affix त added to अश् (_Un_ III. 65), and is final acute (III. 1. 3). The word पान is formed by ल्यूट् affix added to पा, and is acute on the first (VI. 1. 193) owing to the लित् accent. (4) When the first member is a word with which the second member is compared, as:- शस्त्री꣡श्यामा, कु꣡मुदश्येनी, हंस꣡गद्गदा, न्यग्रोध꣡परिमण्डला, दूर्वाका꣡ण्डश्यामा, शरकाण्डगौरी ॥ These compounds are formed by (II. 1. 55). शस्त्री is formed by ङीप् and is final-acute; कुमुद is formed by क affix (कौ मोदते = कुमुद) see (III. 2. 5). _Vartika_)): and is acutely accented on the first, or by _Phit_ _sutra_ II. 3 it has acute on the first. हंस is formed by the _Unadi_ affix स added to हन् (_Unadi_ III. 62), and is finally accented (III. 1. 3). न्यग्रोहति = न्यग्रोधः formed by अच् (III. 1. 134), and ह is irregularly changed into ध as _Panini_ himself uses this form (VII. 3. 5): and it is accented in the middle. The words दूर्वाकाण्ड, शरकाण्ड are Genitive _Tatpurusha_, and their second member has accent on the first syllable (VI. 2. 135), (5) When the first member is an Indeclinable, as, अ꣡ब्राह्मणः, अ꣡वृषलः, कु꣡ब्राह्मणः, कु꣡वृषलः ॥ निष्कौ꣡शाम्बिः, निर्वा꣡राणासिः, अ꣡तिखट्वः, अ꣡तिमालः ॥ All these Indeclinable compounds have _udatta_ on the first, they are formed by (II. 2. 5) &c.

Vart:- In cases of Indeclinable compounds, the rule applies only to those which are formed by the negative Particle अ, by कु, and by Particles (_nipata_). Though नञ्, is one of the _Nipatas_, its separate mention indicates that नञ्-accent debars even the subsequent कृत्-accent as अकरणिः ॥ Therefore, it does not apply here स्नात्वाकालकः which has acute on the final and belongs to _Mayuravyansakadi_ class.

(6) When the first member as in the accusative case, as:- मुहूर्त्त꣡सुखम्, मुहूर्त्त꣡रमणीयम्, सर्वरात्र꣡कल्याणी, सर्वरात्र꣡शोभना ॥ They are formed by (II. 1. 29). मुहूर्त्त belongs to पृषोदरादि class and is acutely accented on the last. सर्वरात्र is formed by the _samasanta_ affix अच् and is finally accented.

(7) When the first member is a _Kritya_-formed word, as, भोज्य॑लवणम्, भोज्योष्ण॑म्, पानीयशीतम्, हरणी꣡यचूर्णम् (II. 1. 68). भोज्य is formed by ण्यत् and has _svarita_ on the final : पानीय and हरणीय are formed by अनीयर् and are accented on the penultimate (VI. 1. 185) and (VI. 1. 217) i. e. on ई꣡ ॥
