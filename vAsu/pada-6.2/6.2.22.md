sutra: पूर्वे भूतपूर्वे
vRtti: पूर्वशब्द उत्तरपदे भूतपूर्ववाचिनि तत्पुरुषे समासे पूर्वपदं प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The first member of a _Tatpurusha_ compound preserves its original accent when the word पूर्व is the second member, and the sense is 'this had been lately----'.

Thus आढ्यो भूतपूर्वः = आढ्यपूर्वः "formerly had been rich". The compound must be analysed in the above way. The compounding takes place by (II. 1. 57) or it belongs to _Mayura_-_vyansakadi_ class. So also दर्शनीयपूर्वः, सुकुमारपूर्वः ॥

Why do we say when meaning 'had been lately'. Observe परमपूर्वः, उत्तमपूर्वः, which should be analysed as परमश्चासौ पूर्वश्चेति ॥ If it is analysed as परमो भूतपूर्वः then it becomes an example under the rule and not a counter-example. In order therefore, to make this rule applicable we must know the sense of the compound.
