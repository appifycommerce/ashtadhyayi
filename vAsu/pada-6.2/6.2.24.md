Thus वि꣡स्पष्ट कटुकम्, वि꣡चित्रकटुकम् व्य॑क्तकटुकम्, वि꣡स्पष्टलवणम्, विचित्रलवणम्, व्य॑क्तलवणम् ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 1. 4), and it should be analysed thus विस्पष्टं कटुकम् &c.

The words विस्पष्ट &c, are indeed here adjectives, and in conjunction with कटु &c, they denote an object possessing those qualities; and therefore not being in apposition, the compound is not a _Karmadharaya_.

The word विस्पष्ट has acute on the first by (VI. 2. 49). The word विचित्र is also acute on the first as it gets the accent of the Indeclinable. Some read the word as विचित्र, which being a _Bahuvrihi_ has also first acute. The word व्य॑क्त has _svarita_ on the first by (VIII. 2. 4). The remaining words of this class are संपन्न꣡, प꣡टु or कटु, पण्डित꣡, कुशल꣡, चपल꣡ and निपुण꣡. Of these, the word संपन्न꣡ has acute on the final by (VI. 2. 144); प꣡टु is formed by उ (_Unadi_ I. 18), which being considered as नित् (_Unadi_ I. 9), it has acute on the first. पण्डित is formed by क्त to the root पड्, and is finally acute (VI. 2. 144). कुशल has accent on the final being formed by a _krit_ affix (कुशान् लाति = कुशलः, ला आदाने, or _Unadi_ I. 106), चपल being formed by a चित् affix (_Unadi_ I. 111), has acute on the final (VI. 1. 163), for चित् is understood in the _Unadi_ _sutra_ _Unadi_. I. 111 from _sutra_ _Unadi_. I. 106. The word निपुण has acute on the final by (VI. 2. 144), being formed by क affix added to पुण् &c.

Why do we say 'of विस्पष्ट &c' Observe परमलवण꣡म् उत्तमलवण꣡म्, both having acute on the final. Why do we say "when followed by a word expressing a quality"? Observe विस्पष्टब्राह्मणः ॥
