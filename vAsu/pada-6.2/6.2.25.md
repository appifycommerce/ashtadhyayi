sutra: श्रज्यावमकन्पापवत्सु भावे कर्मधारये
vRtti: श्र ज्य अवम कन् इत्येतेषु पापशब्दवति चोत्तरपदे कर्मधारये समासे भाववाचि पूर्वपदं प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In a _Karmadharaya_ compound, the first member consisting of a Verbal noun (भाव), preserves its original accent before adjective forms built from श्र (V. 3. 60), ज्य (V. 3. 61) अवम and कन् (V. 3. 64), and before a form built from the word पाप ॥

Thus ग꣡मनश्रेष्ठम्, or ग꣡मनश्रेयः, व꣡चनज्येष्ठम् or वचनज्यायः, ग꣡मनावमम्, व꣡चनावमम्, ग꣡मनकनिष्ठम् or गमनकनीयः ॥ So also ग꣡मनपापिष्ठम्, ग꣡मनपापीयः ॥ All the first members are ल्युट् formed words and have लित् accent i. e. on the first syllable. (VI. 1. 193). The words श्र, ज्य and कन् are substitutes which certain adjectives take in the comparative and superlative degree, and the employment of these forms in the _sutra_ indicates that the comparative and superlative words having these elements should be taken as second members, and so also of पाप, the comparative and superlative are taken, for this is the meaning here of the word पापवत् ॥

Why do we say "श्र &c"? Observe गमनशोभनम् ॥ Why do we say 'a verbal Noun'? Observe गमनश्रेयः, where the word गमन is = गम्यतेऽनेन 'the carriage'. Why do we say 'a _Karmadharaya_ compound'? Observe गमनं श्रेयः = गमनश्रेयः ॥
