vRtti: सप्तम्यन्तं पूर्वपदं सिद्ध शुष्क पक्ष बन्ध इत्येतेषूत्तरपदेषु प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति सा चेत्सप्तमी कालान्न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "A locative-ending word when it does not denote time, preserves its original accent, when followed by सिद्ध, शुष्क, पक्व and बन्ध in a compound."

Thus सांकाश्यसिद्धः or सांकाश्यसिद्धः, काम्पिल्यसिद्धः or काम्पिल्यसिद्धः ॥ The words _samkasya_ and _kampilya_ have acute on the final, and by _Phit_ _Sutra_ (III. 16) in the alternative the accent falls on the middle also. So also निधनशुष्कः, ऊकशुष्कः ॥ The word निधन is derived by क्यु affix added to नि-धाञ् and has acute on the middle; the word ऊक is formed from अव् root by the affix कक्, and has acute on the final. So also भ्राष्ट्रपक्वः, कुम्भीपक्वः, कलशीपक्वः ॥ The words _Kumbhi_ and _Kalasi_ are formed by ङीष् affix and have acute on the final; the word भ्राष्ट्र is formed by ष्ट्रन् affix, and has acute on the beginning. So also चक्रबन्धः चारकबन्धः ॥ The word _chakra_ has acute on the final, and _charaka_ being formed by ण्वुल् has acute on the first.

Why do we say 'when not denoting time'? Observe पूर्वाह्णसिद्धः, अपराह्णसिद्धः ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 1. 41). The accent of the Locative _Tatpurusha_ taught in (VI. 2. 1) was debarred by _Krit_-accent taught (VI. 2. 144). The present _sutra_ debars this last rule regarding _Krit_ accent, and reordains the Locative _Tatpurusha_ accent when the _Krit_-words are सिद्ध &c.
