sutra: कुरुगार्हपतरिक्तगुर्वसूतजरत्यश्लीलदृढरूपा पारेवडबा तैतिलकद्रूः पण्यकम्बलो दासीभाराणां च
vRtti: कुरुगार्हपत रिक्तगुरु असूतजरती अश्लीलदृढरूपा पारेवडबा तैतिलकद्रू पण्यकम्बल इत्येते समासास्तेषां दासीभारादीनां च पूर्वपदप्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The first member retains its accent in the following :- '_Kuru_-_garhapata_', '_Rikta_-_guru_', '_Asuta_-_jarati_', '_Aslila_-_dridha_-_rupa_', '_Pare_-_vadaba_', '_Taitila_-_kadruh_', '_Panya_-_kambalah_' and '_Dasi_-_bhara_ &c'.

The first seven words are compounds, the first two of these are exhibited without any case-ending, the remaining five are in nominative Singular. Thus कुरु꣡गार्हपतम् (कुरूणां गार्हपत, _Kuru_ is formed by कु affix added to कृ _Unadi_ I. 24) and has acute on the final.

Vart:- So also वृ꣡जिगार्हपतम् , the word _Vriji_ has acute accent on the first.

So also रिक्तो गुरुः = रि꣡क्तगुरुः or रिक्त꣡गुरुः for _rikta_ has acute either on the first or on the second (VI. I. 208). So also असूता जरती = अ꣡सूतजरती, अश्लीलादृढरूपा = अ꣡श्लील दृढरूपा ॥ _Asuta_ and _aslila_ being formed by नञ् particle have acute on the first : (VI. 2. 2). That which has श्री is called श्लील, the affix लच् being added by its belonging to _Sidhmadi_ class, and र changed to ल by its belonging to _kapilakadi_ class. So also पारे꣡वडबा, this is = पारेवडबेव ॥ This is a _samasa_ with the force of इव, and there is elision of the case ending. The word पार belongs to _Ghritadi_ class, and has acute on the final. तैतिलानां कद्रूः = तैतिल꣡कद्रूः, the son or pupil of _Titilin_ is _Taitila_ formed by अण् affix. पण्यकम्बलः, _panya_ ends in यत् and has acute on the first (VI. 1. 213).

Vart:- प꣡ण्यकम्बलः has acute on the first only when it is a name. Otherwise in पणितव्ये कम्बले compound, the accent will be on the final by the general rule (VI. I. 223). The word पण्य being formed by यत् affix (III. I. 101) is acutely accented on the first (VI. I. 213). The word पण्यकम्बलः is as Name when it means the market-blanket i. e. a blanket of a well known determinate size and fixed price, which is generally kept for sale by the blanket-sellers. But when the compound means a saleable blanket, it takes the _samasa_ accent (VI. 1. 223). If it be objected what is the use this _Vartika_, for the word पण्य being formed by a _kritya_ affix, will retain its accent in the _Tatpurusha_, by (VI. 2. 2), we reply that the कृत्य used in (VI. 2. 2) relates to _pratipadokta_ _kritya_ compounds such as ordained by कृत्यतुल्याख्या अजात्या (II. 1. 68), while here the compound is by विशेषणं विशेष्येण (II. 1. 51) and is a general compound. So also दास्याभारः = दासी꣡भारः ॥ The words belonging to _Dasi_ _bharadi_ class are all those _Tatpurusha_ compound words, not governed by any of the rules of accent, in which it is desired that the first member should retain its accent. Some of them are देव꣡जूतिः, देव꣡सूतिः, देववीतिः, व꣡सुनीतिः ॥ _Vasu_ has acute on the first being formed by a नित् affix _Unadi_ l. 9 10). ओषधिः = ओषोधीयतेऽस्याम्, formed by कि affix (III. 3. 93), ओष being formed by घञ् has acute on the first (VI. 1. 197). चन्द्र꣡माः is formed by असि affix added to the root माङ् माने preceded by the _upapada_ चन्द्र as, चन्द्र + मा + अस् = चन्द्रमस्, the affix being treated as डित् (_Unadi_ IV. 228), and चन्द्र is formed by रक affix (_Unadi_ II. 13) and has acute on the final.
