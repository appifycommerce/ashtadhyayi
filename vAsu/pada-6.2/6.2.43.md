Thus यू꣡पदारु, कुण्डल꣡हिरण्यम् ॥ The word यूप् has accent on the first syllable, as it is formed by प (_Unadi_ III. 27) treated as a नित् (_Unadi_ III. 26). The word कुण्डल is formed by कल affix which is treated as चित् (_Unadi_ I. 108) and has acute on the final. So also र꣡थदारु, वल्लीहिरण्यम् ॥ _Ratha_ is first-acute formed by _kthan_ affix (_Unadi_ II. 2). _Valli_ has acute on the final formed by ङीष् affix. (4.1.41) Why do we say 'it being suited to the first'? Observe कुबेरबलिः ॥ This accent applies when the second member denoting the material is modified into the first by workmanship. The composition takes place by (2.1.36).
