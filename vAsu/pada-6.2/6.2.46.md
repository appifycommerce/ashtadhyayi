sutra: कर्मधारयेऽनिष्ठा
vRtti: कर्मधारये समासे क्तान्त उत्तरपदेऽनिष्ठान्तं पूर्वपदं प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "Before a Past Participle in '_kta_', the first member, when it itself is not a Past Participle, retains its original accent in a _Karmadharaya_ compound."
---
This rule is confined to the Past Participles and the Nouns specifically mentioned in (II. 1. 59); on the maxim of _pratipadokta_ &c. Thus श्रेणिकृताः, पूगकृताः, ऊककृताः, निधनकृताः ॥ The word श्रेणि has acute on the first as it is formed by the affix नि which is considered नित् (_Unadi_ IV. 51). The word पूग is end-acute as it is formed by the affix गक् (_Unadi_ I. 124). The word ऊक is also end-acute (VI. 2. 32). The word निध has acute on the middle. Why do we say in a _Karmadharaya_ compound? Observe श्रेण्या कृतं = श्रेनिकृतम् ॥ Why do we say 'when it is a non-_nishtha_ word ?' Observe कृताकृतम् ॥ Here the compounding is by (II. 1. 60).
