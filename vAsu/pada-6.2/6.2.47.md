sutra: अहीने द्वितीया
vRtti: अहीनवाचिनि समासे क्तान्त उत्तरपदे द्वितीयान्तं पूर्वपदं प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "Before a Past Participle in '_kta_', a word ending in the Accusative case retains its accent, when it does not mean a separation."

Thus कष्टश्रितः, त्रिशकलपतितः, ग्रामगतः ॥ _Kashta_ has acute on the end, _trisakala_ is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound (_trini_ _sakalani_ _asya_), and consequently acute on the first : _grama_ has acute on the first as it is formed by the नित् affix मन् added to ग्रस्, the final being replaced by आ (_Unadi_ I. 143) ॥ Why do we say 'when not meaning separation'? Observe कान्तारातीतः, योजनातीतः,  because one has taken himself beyond _kantara_ and _yojana_.

Vart:- This rule does not apply when the Past Participle has an _upasarga_ attached; as सुखप्राप्तः, दुःखप्राप्तः, सुखापन्नः, दुःखापन्नः (VI. 4. 144). This is an exception to rule (VI. 2. 144).
