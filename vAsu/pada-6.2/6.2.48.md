Thus अहिहतः or अहि हतः रुद्रहतः, वज्रहतः, महाराजहतः, नखनिर्भिन्ना, दात्रलूना ॥ The word '_ahi_' is derived from हन् with the proposition आ which is shortened, and the affix इण् (_Unadi_ IV. 138), and has acute on the final, according to others the acute is on the first: _Rudra_ is formed by रक् affix (_Unadi_ II. 22) added to the causative रोदि; _Maharaja_ is formed by the _Samasanta_ affix टच्; _nakha_ is formed by ख affix added to नह् (_Unadi_ V. 23) or it may be a _Bahuvrihi_ नास्य खमस्ति = नखः, formed by अच् (V. 4. 121), and has acute on the final : _Datra_ is formed by ष्ट्रन् (III. 2. 182). Why do we say when having a Passive signification? Observe रथेन यातः = रथयातः, the '_kta_' is added to a verb of motion with an Active significance.
