sutra: गतिरनन्तरः
vRtti: क्ते कर्मणीति वर्त्तते । कर्मवाचिनि क्तान्त उत्तरपदे गतिरनन्तरः पूर्वपदं प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A word called _Gati_ (I. 4. 60) when standing immediately before a Participle in '_kta_' having a Passive significance, retains its accent.

Thus प्रकृतः, प्रहृतः ॥ Here one of the following rules would have applied otherwise, namely, either (1) the _Samasa_ end-acute (IV. 1. 223) (2) or the Indeclinable first member to retain its accent (VI. 2. 2), (3) or the end acute by (VI. 2. 139) and (VI. 2. 144). The present _sutra_ debars all these. Why do we say 'immediately?' Observe अभ्युद्धृतः, समुद्धृतः, समुदाहृतः ॥ Where the distant _Gati_ words अभि and सम् do not preserve their accent, but the immediately preceding _Gati_, as उत् does retain its accent, though it is not the first member of the compound word. Compare also (VIII. 2. 70). But in दूरात् + आगतः (_agata_ being governed by this rule) we have to दूरादागतः, (II. 5. 39) and (VI. 3. 2) where (VI. 2. 144) has its scope, though it had not its scope in अभि + उद्धृतः = अभ्युद्धृतः ॥ In the former case this maxim applies कृद्ग्रहणे गतिकारकपूर्वस्यापि ग्रहणं ॥ "A _Krit_ affix denotes whenever it is employed, a word-form which begins with that to which that _Krit_ affix has been added, and which ends with the _Krit_ affix, but moreover should a _Gati_ or a noun such as denotes a case-relation have been prefixed to that word-form, then the _Krit_ affix must denote the same word-form together with the _Gati_ or the noun which may have been prefixed to it". In the second example, this maxim is not applied, because scope should be given to the word अनन्तर in this aphorism. When the Participle has not a Passive significance, the rule does not apply because the word कर्मणि is understood here also; as, प्रकृतः कटं देवदत्तः ॥ This _sutra_ debars (VI. 2. 144).
