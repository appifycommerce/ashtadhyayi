sutra: कतरकतमौ कर्मधारये
vRtti: कतरशब्दः कतमशब्दश्च पूर्वपदं कर्मधारये समासेऽन्यरतस्यां प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The words कतर and कतम standing as the first member of a compound retain optionally their original accent in a _Karmadharaya_."

Thus कतर꣡कठः or कतरकठः꣡, कतम꣡कठः or कतमकठः꣡ ॥ The word _Karmadharaya_ is used for the sake of the next _sutra_, this _sutra_ could have done without it, as '_katara_' and '_katama_' by the maxim of _pratipadokta_, form only _Karmadharaya_ compound by (II. I. 63).
