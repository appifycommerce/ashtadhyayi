Thus ग꣡मनचिरम् or ग꣡मनकृच्छ्रम्, व्याह꣡रणचिरम् or  व्याह꣡रणकृच्छ्रम् ॥ The words गमन and व्याहरण are formed by ल्युट् affix, and have लित् accent (6.1.193). This compound belongs either to the class of _Mayura_-_vyansakadi_ (2.1.72), or of an attribute and the thing qualified. When going to a place is delayed owing to some defective arrangement or cause, or becomes difficult, there is produced an obstacle or hinderance, and is called गमनचिरं or गमनकृच्छ्रं ॥ Why do we say 'which experiences a hinderance'? Observe मुत्रकृच्छ्रम् ॥
