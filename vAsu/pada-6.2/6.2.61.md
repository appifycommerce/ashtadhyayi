Thus नि꣡त्यप्रहसितः or नित्यप्रहसितः꣡, सतत꣡प्रहसितः or सततप्रहसितः꣡ ॥ These are Accusative compounds formed under Rule (II. I. 28). निस्य is formed by त्यप् affix added to the _upasarga_ नि (IV. 2. 104) _Vartika_)); and has acute on the first, the _upasarga_ retaining its accent, the affix being _anudatta_ (III. I. 4). The word सतत being formed by क्त affix with the force of भावः, has acute on final by (VI. 2. 14). If it be considered to have been formed by कर्मणि क्त, then the accent will be on the beginning by (VI. 2. 49). Why do we say when the first term means 'always'? Observe मुहूर्त्तप्रहसितः꣡ ॥ In the case of नित्यप्रहसितः &c the _samasa_ accent (VI. 1. 223) was first set aside by the Accusative _Tatpurusha_ accent (VI. 2. 2). this in its turn was set aside by क्त accent (VI. 2. 144), which is again debarred by the present.
