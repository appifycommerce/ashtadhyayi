sutra: आदिरुदात्तः
vRtti: आदिरुदात्त इत्येतदधिकृतमित उत्तरं यद्वक्ष्यामस्तत्र पूर्वपदस्यादिरुदात्तो भवतीत्येवं तद्वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: In the following up to (VI. 2. 91) inclusive the phrase 'the first syllable in-(the word standing in the Nominative) has the acute', is to be always supplied.

This is an _adhikara_ aphorism. The first syllable of the पूर्वपद will get the acute in the following aphorisms. In short, the phrase '_adir_ _udatta_' should be supplied to complete the sense of the subsequent _sutras_. The very next _sutra_ illustrates it. That _sutra_ literally means "a word in the Locative case or a word denoting the name of the receiver of a tax or tribute, standing before a word denoting that which is lawful, but not before हरण". To complete the sense we must supply the words "has acute on the first syllable". Thus स्तूपेशाणः, मुकुटे कार्षापणम्, याज्ञिकाश्वः, वैयाकरणहस्ती ॥ The word आदि 'the first syllable' is understood upto (VI.2.91), the word उदात्त has longer stretch: it governs upto (VI.2.137).
