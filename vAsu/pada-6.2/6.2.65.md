sutra: सप्तमीहारिणौ धर्म्येऽहरणे
vRtti: सप्तम्यन्तं हारिवाचि च पूर्वपदं धर्म्यवाचिनि हरणशब्दादन्यस्मिन्नुत्तरपदे आद्युदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The first member of a compound, if in the Locative case or denoting the name of the Receiver of the tax, has acute on the first syllable, when the second member is a word denoting 'what is lawful', but not when it is हरण ॥"

The word हारिण् means 'appropriates the dues or taxes': and धर्म्यम् means 'the due or tax which has been determined by the custom or usage, of the country, town, sect or family, that which one is lawfully entitled to get'. The word धर्म्य is formed by यत् under (IV. 4. 91) and (IV. 4. 92) and has the sense of both. Of Locative words we have the following examples : - स्तुपे-शाणः मुकुटे- कार्षापणम्, हले-द्विपदिका, हले-त्रिपदिका, दृषदि-माषकः ॥ These compounds are formed under (II. 1. 44), and the sign of the Locative is not elided by (VI. 3. 9) and (VI. 3. 10). With the name of a due-receiver हारी we have the following :- याज्ञिकाश्वः 'the horse which is the customary due of the sacrificer'. So also वैयाकरणहस्ती, मातुलाश्वः, पितृव्यगवः ॥ In some places the established usage is to give a शाण coin in every sacred Tope &c, or to give a horse to a sacrificer &c. Why do we say 'what is lawful'? Observe स्तम्बेरमः, कर्मकर वर्द्धितकः वर्द्धितको नाम मूले स्थूलोग्रे सूक्ष्म ओदन पिण्डः, स कर्मकराय दीयते, अन्यथा कर्म न कुर्यादिति, न त्वयं धर्मः ॥ Why do we say "but not before हरण"? Observe वाडवहरणम् ' that which is given to a mare'. हरण is that customary food which is given to a mare after she has been covored, in order to strengthen her. The word हरण is a _Krit_-formed word, its exclusion here indicates that other _Krit_-formed words however are governed by this rule when preceded by a हारी denoting word; and thus this _sutra_ supersedes the _Krit_ accent enjoined by (VI. 2. 139), so far. Thus वाडवहार्यः has acute on the first by this rule, the subsequent (VI. 2. 139) not applying.
