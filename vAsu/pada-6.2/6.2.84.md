sutra: ग्रामेऽनिवसन्तः
vRtti: ग्रामशब्द उत्तरपदे पूर्वपदमाद्युदात्तं भवति न चेन्निवसद्वाचि भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Before ग्राम, the first syllable of the first member has acute, when thereby inhabitants are not meant.

Thus म꣡ल्लग्रामः, व꣡णिग्ग्रामः ॥ Here ग्राम is equal to समूह 'an assembly'. देवग्रामः = देवस्वामिकः ॥ Why do we say 'when not meaning inhabitants'. Observe दाक्षिग्रामः 'a village inhabited by the descendants of _Daksha_', माहिकग्रामः 'a village inhabited by _Mahikas_'.
