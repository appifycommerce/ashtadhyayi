sutra: शारदेऽनार्तवे
vRtti: ऋतौ भवमार्तवम् । अनार्तववाचिनि शारदशब्द उत्तरपदे तत्पुरुषे समासे पूर्वपदं प्रकृतिस्वरं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "In a _Tatpurusha_ compound the first member preserves its original accent, when the second member is the word शारद, having any other sense than that of 'autumnal'."

The word आर्तव means appertaining to season (ऋतु) i. e. when the word शारद does not refer to the season of शरत् or autumn. Thus रज्जुशारदमुदकम् 'fresh drawn water'. So also दृषत् शारदाः सक्तवः 'the _saktu_ flour fresh from the mill'. The word शारद means here 'fresh' 'new': and it forms an invariable compound. The word रज्जु is formed by उ affix added to सृज् (_Unadi_ I. 15), the स being elided. The affix उ is treated as नित् (_Unadi_ I. 9) and the accent falls on the first syllable (VI. 1. 197). The word दृषत् is formed by the augment ष and shortening of the vowel of the root दृ 'to tear' (दृणाति), and the affix अदिक् (_Unadi_ 1. 131) and has accent on the final (III. 1. 3).

Why do we say 'when not meaning autumnal'? Observe परमशारदम्, उत्तमशारदम् 'the best autumnal grass &c'. (VI. 1. 223).
