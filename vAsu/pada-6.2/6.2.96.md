sutra: उदकेऽकेवले
vRtti: अकेवलं मिश्रं तद्वाचिनि समासे उदकशब्द उत्तरपदे पूर्वपदमन्तोदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Before the word उदक, when the compound denotes a mixture, the last syllable of the first member has the acute.
---
Thus गुडोदकम् or गुडोदकम्, तिलोदकम् or तिलोदकम् ॥ When we have already made the उ and ल acute by this rule, then the _svarita_ accent may result optionally, by the combination of the acute अ of _guda_ and _tila_ and the subsequent grave उ of उदक, by Rule (VIII. 2. 6). The word अकेवल in means mixture. When mixture is not meant, this rule does not apply. As शीतोदकम्, उष्णोदकम् ॥
