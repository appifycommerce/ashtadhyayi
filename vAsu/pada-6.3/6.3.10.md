sutra: कारनाम्नि च प्राचां हलादौ
vRtti: प्राचां देशे यत्कारनाम तत्र हलादादुत्तरपदे हलदन्तादुत्तरस्याः सप्तम्या अलुग्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The Locative-case affix is not elided after a stem ending in a consonant or a short अ, in the name of a tax of the Eastern people, when the second member begins with a consonant.

Thus सूपेशाणः, दृषदिमाषकः, हलेद्विपदिका, हलेत्रिपदिका ॥ All these are names of taxes, and would have retained the Locative ending even by the last rule. The present rule makes a _niyama_ or restriction, which is threefold, namely (1) when it is the name of a tax, and no other word, (2) when it belongs to the Eastern people and no other people, (3) and when the second member begins with a consonant.

Why do we say when it is the name of a tax.? Observe अभ्यर्हितेपशुः = अभ्यर्हितपशुः ॥ It is the name of 'a duty or dues', but not of a 'tax'. Why do we say "of the Eastern people"? Observe यूथेपशुः = यूथपशुः ॥ Why do we say 'before a second member beginning with a consonant'? Observe अविकटे उरणः = अविकटोरणः ॥ So also नद्यां दोहनी = नदीदोहनी ॥ For accent of these words see (VI. 2. 65).
