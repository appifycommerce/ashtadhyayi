sutra: चौ
vRtti: चौ परतः पूर्वपदस्य दीर्घो भवति ॥ चावित्यञ्चतिलुप्तनकाराकारो गृह्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The final vowel of the preceding member is lengthened before अञ्च, when it assumes the form च, having lost its nasal and the vowel.

Thus दधीचः पश्य, दधीचा, दधीचे, मधूचः पश्य, मधूचा, मधूचे ॥ The nasal of अञ्च is elided by (VI. 4. 24), and the अ by (VI. 4. 138). In दधि + अच् the इ is not changed to its semivowel, though that is an _antaranga_ rule, because the present _sutra_ ordains specifically long ई, and so also दधी + अच् and मधू + अच् ॥ See also (VI. 3. 92).
