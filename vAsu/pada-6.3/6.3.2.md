Thus स्तोकान्मुक्तः, अल्पान्मुक्तः, अन्तिकादागतः, अभ्याशादागतः, दूरादागतः, विप्रकृष्टादागतः, कृच्छ्रान्मुक्तः ॥ By (1.2.46), a case-inflected word when forming part of a compound is called _pratipadika_, and by (2.4.71) the endings of a _Pratipadika_ are elided. Therefore, in forming the compound of स्तोकात् मुक्तः, the ablative ending required to be dropped. The present _sutra_ prevents that. The words स्तोक &c in the dual and plural are never compounded, and consequently this rule does not apply to them. Thus स्तोकाभ्यां मुक्तः, स्तोकेभ्यः मुक्तः are separate words and not compounds, for not being treated as compounds, these are not one _Pada_ (एकपद) or one word, and do not have one accent, for in one word, there is only one acute. Thus while स्तोकान्मुक्तः꣡ being one compound word will have one acute (6.1.158), (6.2.144), the word स्तोकाभ्यां मुक्तः being treated as two words, will have separate acute accents. The above compounding takes place by (2.1.39).

Vart:- The word ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिन् should be enumerated in this connection. Here also the Ablative is not elided. Thus ब्राह्मणादादाय शंसति = ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिन् "a kind of _Ritvik_ priest".
