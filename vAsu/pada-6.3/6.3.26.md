sutra: देवताद्वन्द्वे च
vRtti: देवतावाचिनां यो द्वन्द्वस्तत्रोत्तरपदे पूर्वपदस्थानङादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The आनङ् is the substitute for the final of the first member in a _Dwandva_ compound of the names of the _Devtas_.
---   
Thus इन्द्रावरुणौ, इन्द्रासोमौ, इन्द्राबृहस्पती, मित्रावरुणौ ॥ The repetition of the word _Dvandva_ in this _sutra_, in spite of its _anuvritti_ from the last, shows that the rule applies only to such _Dvandvas_ which are generally found in the Vedas and are well-known. It does not apply to compounds like ब्रह्मप्रजापति, शिववैश्रवणौ ॥ In fact it applies to the _Dvandva_ of those _Devatas_ whose companionship is well-known.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated with regard to वायु in both cases, whether first or last, as अग्निवायू or वाय्वग्नी ॥
