sutra: वा शोकष्यञ्रोगेषु
vRtti: शोक ष्यञ् रोग इत्येतेषु परतो हृदयस्य वा हृदित्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "हृद is optionally the substitute for हृदय, when the words शोक, and रोग or the affix ष्यङ् follows."

Thus हृच्छोकः or हृदयशोकः, सौहार्द्यम् or सौहृदय्यम् ॥ Here ष्यङ् is added as हृदय belongs to _Brahmanadi_ class (V. I. I24). When हृद् is substituted there is _Vriddhi_ of both the members सु and हृ by (VII. 3. 19). So also हृद्रोगः or हृदयरोगः ॥ All these forms could have been got from हृत् which is a full word sui generis, having the same meaning as हृदय ॥ The substitution taught in this _sutra_ is rather unnecessary.
