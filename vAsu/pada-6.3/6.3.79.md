sutra: ग्रन्थान्ताधिके च
vRtti: ग्रन्थान्तेऽधिके च वर्त्तमानस्य सहशब्दस्य स इत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "स is the substitute for सह, when it has the sense of 'upto the end' (in connection with a literary work), or 'more'."

Thus सकलं = कलान्तं ज्योतिषमधीते ॥ So also समुहूर्तम् = (मुहूर्तान्तम्) ॥ स संग्रह (= संग्रहान्तम्) व्याकरणमधीते ॥ These are all _Avyayibhava_ compounds by अन्तवचने (II. 1. 6). Therefore, when a word, denoting time, is the second member, सह would not be changed to स, because of the prohibition in (VI. 3. 81). The present _sutra_ removes that prohibition by anticipation, with regard to time-denoting words even, when the meaning is that 'of the end of a book'. When the sense is that of 'more', we have सद्रोणाखारी, समाषः कार्षापणः सकाकिणीको माषः ॥
