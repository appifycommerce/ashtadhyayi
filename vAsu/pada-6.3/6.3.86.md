sutra: चरणे ब्रह्मचारिणि
vRtti: चरणे गम्यमाने ब्रह्मचारिण्युत्तरपदे समानस्य स इत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "स is substituted for समान before ब्रह्मचारिन् when it denotes persons engaged in fulfilling a common vow of studying the Vedas."

Thus समानो ब्रह्मचारी = सब्रह्मचारी ॥ ब्रह्म means the Vedas. The vow of studying the _Veda_, is also called ब्रह्म ॥ He who is engaged in the performance of that vow is called ब्रह्मचारिन् ॥ समान refers to the vow, the vow of studying being common to both : i. e. समाने ब्रह्मणि व्रतचारी = सब्रह्मचारी ॥ According to _Bhattoji_ _Dikshit_ चरणे in the _sutra_ means a शाखा or a department of Vedic study. He who has a common (_samana_) branch (_charana_) is a _sabrahmchari_.
