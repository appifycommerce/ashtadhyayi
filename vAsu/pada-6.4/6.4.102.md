As श्रुधी हविमिन्द्र, शृणुधी, गिरः, पूर्धि, उरुकृदुरुणस्कृ and अवावृधि, ॥

In शृणुधी, the हि is not elided after the उ of  णु as it was required by (VI. 4. 106), since the present aphorism specifically mentions it. The lengthening takes place by (VI. 3. 137). The forms other than शृणुधि are irregular; शप् being added diversely by (III. 1. 85), and then elided diversely by बहुलं छन्दसि (II. 4. 73)
