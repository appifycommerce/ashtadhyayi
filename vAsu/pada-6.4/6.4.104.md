sutra: चिणो लुक्
vRtti: चिण उत्तरस्य प्रत्ययस्य लुग्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The personal-endings are elided after चिण्, the third person, singular Passive of the Aorist."
---
As अहारि, अलावि, अकारि, अपाचि ॥ So also अकारितराम्, अहारितमाम्, here the elision of the personal affix त (III. I. 60) of the Aorist being considered as _asiddha_, the affixes तरप् and तमप् are not elided: though if the _sutra_ were to be literally interpreted, every affix after चिण्, ought to be elided. Or the word क्ङिति is understood here; so that कित् and ङित् affixes of चिण् are elided and not every affix.
