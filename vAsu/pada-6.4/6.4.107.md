sutra: लोपश्चास्यान्यतरस्यां म्वोः
vRtti: योयमुकारोऽसंयोगपूर्वस्तदन्तस्य प्रत्ययस्यान्यतरस्यां लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The उ of the _vikarana_ उ and श्नु, where not preceded by a conjunct consonant, may be elided optionally before a personal ending beginning with म् or व् ॥"

Thus सुन्वः or सुनुवः, सुन्मः, सुनुमः, तन्वः, तनुवः, तन्मः, तनुमः ॥ The उ must belong to the affix, and should not be part of the root. Therefore not in युवः, युमः ॥

Why do we say 'not preceded by a conjunct consonant'? Observe शक्नुवः, शक्नुमः only. Though the elision word लुक् was understood in this _sutra_, the mention of लोप indicates that the final is only to be elided, and not the whole affix नु ॥ It is a general maxim that the words लुक्, श्लु and लुप् cause the elision of the whole affix, while '_lopa_' will cause elision of the final letter only of the affix. If the whole affix be elided, we could not get सुन्वः &c., Moreover, in कुर्व and कुर्म formed by _guna_ of कृ, there would have been no _guna_, had the word लुक् been used, for (I. 1. 63), would have prevented _guna_; but by using the word लोप we have such _guna_ also by (I. 1. 62).
