sutra: ये च
vRtti: यकारादौ च प्रत्यये परतः करोतेरुत्तरस्योकारप्रत्ययस्य नित्यं लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix उ of the stem कुरु is always elided before a personal ending beginning with a य ॥
---
Thus कुर्यात्, कुर्याताम् and कुर्युः ॥ The augment यासुट् is treated here as an affix, and it makes the personal ending to which it is added, as an affix beginning with य ॥
