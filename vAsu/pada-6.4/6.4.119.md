sutra: घ्वसोरेद्धावभ्यासलोपश्च
vRtti: घुसंज्ञकानामङ्गानामस्तेश्च एकारादेशो भवति ही परतोऽभ्यासलोपश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: "For the final vowel of the roots दा and धा (घु), and for the स् of अस्, is substituted ए before the Imperative ending हि; and thereby the reduplicated syllable of दा and धा is elided."
---
Thus देहि, and धेहि, of घु, and एधि of अस्, the स being elided by this _sutra_, and अ being elided by (VI. 4. 111). This लोप of the present _sutra_ should be considered as having an indicatory श् so that the whole of the reduplicated and not only the final letter of the _abhyasa_ (I. 1. 55) is elided.
