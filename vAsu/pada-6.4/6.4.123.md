sutra: राधो हिंसायाम्
vRtti: राधो हिंसायामर्थेऽवर्णस्य एकार आदेशो भवति, अभ्यासलोपश्च लिटि क्ङिति परतस्थलि च सेटि ॥
vRtti_eng: "ए is substituted for the आ of राध when meaning 'to hurt some one', and the reduplicate is elided, before the affixes of the Perfect having an indicatory क् (or ङ्), as well as before थल् with the इट् augment."

Thus अपरेधतुः, अपरेधुः, अपरेधिथ, but रराधतुः, रराधुः, रराधिथ in any other sense than that of 'hurting'. In this _sutra_ the long आ of राध is to be replaced by ए, the _anuvritti_ of short अ (अतः (VI. 4. 120)) is therefore not appropriate here. We should either read the _anuvritti_ of आ from (VI. 4. 112), or we should read the word एकहलमध्ये in this way "in राध् whatever stands between two simple consonants is replaced by ए".
