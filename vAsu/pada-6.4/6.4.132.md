sutra: वाह ऊठ्
vRtti: वाह इत्येवमन्तस्य भस्य ऊठ् इत्येतत्संप्रसारणं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The व् in वाह् is vocalised to ऊ (ऊठ्), when the compound stem is _Bha_.

The word वाह् is a ण्वि formed stem by (III.2.64). It can never stand alone, but, must be preceded by an _upapada_: hence we have used the word "compound." Thus प्रष्ठौहः, प्रष्ठौहा, प्रष्ठौहे, दित्यौहः, दित्यौहा, दित्यौहे ॥  By (VI.1.108), ऊ + आ (of वा) = ऊ; and then प्रष्ठ + उह् = प्रष्ठौहः; the _Vriddhi_ being substituted by (VI.1.89). This form could have been evolved by simple _samprasarana_ thus : प्रष्ठ + वह् + शस् = प्रष्ठ + उह् + अस् (VI.1.108) = प्रष्ठ + ओह् + अस् (the affix ण्वि (III.2.64), will produce _guna_) = प्रष्ठौहः (VI.1.88). In fact ण्वि is never added to वह् (III.2.64) unless the preceding member ends in अ and that अ + ओ of वा will always produce औ ॥ The making of this special _samprasarana_ in ऊठ्, indicates the existence of following maxim: असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे; and the _samprasarana_ being a _bahiranga_ operation, is considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of _guna_ which is an _antaranga_ operation : therefore, we can never get the form ओह ॥
