sutra: सूर्यतिष्यागस्त्यमत्स्यानां य
vRtti: सूर्य तिष्य अगस्त्य मत्स्य इत्येतेषां यकारस्य उपधाया भस्य लोपो भवति ईति परतस्तद्धिते च ॥
vRtti_eng: Of the _bha_ stems सूर्य, तिष्य, अगस्त्य and मत्स्य, (and their derivatives when they are _Bha_) the penultimate य् is also elided before the long ई and a _Taddhita_ affix.

Thus सूर्येणैकादिक् = सौरी (सूर्य + अण् under (IV. 3. 112) = सौर्य, then ई of ङीप् = सौरी), as सौरी बलाका ॥

So also तिष्य – तैषमहः, तैषी रात्रिः ॥ So also अगस्त्यस्यापत्यं स्त्री = आगस्ती (IV. 1. 114), आगस्तीयः; So also मत्स्य – मत्सी with ङीष् as it belongs to _Gauradi_ class (IV. 1. 40). If the words सूर्य &c, were to be qualified by the word भ, then the _sutra_ would mean सूर्यादीनां भसंज्ञानां "of सूर्य &c, when they get the designation of भ"; and the result of this interpretation would be, that the rule would apply to cases like सूर्यस्य स्त्री = सूरी, आगस्त्यस्य स्त्री = आगस्ती &c, only, where the forms सूर्य &c, are _Bha_, and not to their derivatives, as सौर्य &c: and there would not have been the forms like सौरी बलाका; because, here the word सूर्य is not _Bha_ before the affix ई, but the word सौर्य is _Bha_. Hence we have introduced the words "and their derivatives" in the translation, so as to cover the cases like सौरी बलाका ॥

In the last example, we again have an illustration, of the rule (VI. 4. 22), which says that for purposes of _asiddha_ the आश्रय must be the same. Thus सौर्य + ई = सौर्य् + अ _lopa_ + ई = सौरी ॥ But सौर्य itself was formed by the elision of अ of सूर्य before the affix अण्, thus, सूर्य + अण् = सौर्य् + ० + सौर्य् (last _sutra_) = सौर्य ॥ But if this _lopa_ be considered as _asiddha_ by (VI. 4. 22), then we have the following equation सौर्य् + ० + अ (of अण्) + ई = सौर्य् + ० + ० (अ of अण् being elided by (VI. 4. 148) + ई ॥ Here य् cannot be elided, as it is not _upadha_ or penultimate: because the first _lopa_ is considered _asiddha_. But it is not to be so considered, as their scopes (आश्रय) are different. Hence we have the elision of य् by this _sutra_. It should not be objected that the य् here is not penultimate, but ultimate: as सौर्य + ई = सौर्य् + ० + ई (अ elided by the last _sutra_), and thus य् is ultimate. Here, however, rule (VI. 4. 22), applies. This elision of अ will be considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of the elision of य्, their scope being the same. So being considered _asiddha_, य् still retains its designation of _upadha_ and is elided by the present _sutra_. It should be remembered here, that we could not take help of the rule of _sthanivat_-_bhava_, because for purposes of यलोप, that rule is set aside. See (I. 1. 58).

Why do we say the penultimate य्? Observe मत्स्यचरी ॥ This word is thus formed. The affix चरट् is added to मत्सी by (V. 3. 53), in the sense of मत्सी भूतपूर्वा ॥ Then the मत्सी becomes masculine मत्स्य by (VI. 4. 35), and we have मत्स्यचर ॥ This word takes ङीप् by (IV. 1. 15), because it is formed by an affix having an indicatory ट् ॥ Thus मत्स्यचर + ई, and the word is भ, but the य is not elided, because it is not penultimate. The य has been read for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ : उपधायाः alone would have been enough for the purposes of this aphorism. The rule contained in this _sutra_ is rather too general; it is limited by the following _vartikas_, which enumerate the conditions under which the elision takes place.

Vart:- The य of मत्स्य is elided before the feminine ई only: therefore not here मत्स्यस्येदं मांसं = मात्स्यम् ॥  

Vart:-  Of सूर्य and अगस्त्य before the affixes छ, and ई (of the feminine): as सौरीयः, सौरी, आगस्तीयः, आगस्ती ॥ But not here सौर्यं चरुं निर्वपेत्, आगस्त्य formed with the Patronymic अण् (IV. I. 114)

Vart:- Of तिष्य and पुष्य when referring to asterisms, as, तिष्येण नक्षत्रेण युक्तः कालः = तैषः, पौषः (IV. 2. 3).

Vart:- Of अन्तिक before the affix तसि, the क is elided, and the word has acute on the first syllable : as, अन्तितः in अन्तितो न दूरात्(V. 4. 45).

Vart:- Before the affix तम, it loses the syllable तिक as well as क, as अन्तमः or अन्तितमः, in अग्रे त्वं नो अन्तिमः अन्तितमे अवरोहति ॥

Vart:- The elision of क of अन्तिक takes place diversely, before the second member also, as अन्तिके सीदति = अन्तिषत् (स changed to ष by (VIII. 3. 106))

Vart:- The elision takes place also before the affix य, as अन्तियः, this is found in the _Atharva_-_Veda_, (अन्तिके भवः, with the affix यत् (IV. 4. 110)).
