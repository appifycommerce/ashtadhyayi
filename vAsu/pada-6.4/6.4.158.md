sutra: बहोर्लोपो भू च बहोः
vRtti: बहोरुत्तरेषामिष्ठेमेयसां लोपो भवति तस्य च बहोः स्थाने भू इत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The इ and ई of these affixes (इमन् and ईयस्) are elided after बहु, and for बहु is substituted भू ॥

Thus भूयान्, भूमा ॥ In the case of इष्ठ, the following rule 159 will apply. Under (I. I. 54) and (I.1.67), बहोः being in the Ablative, the first letter of the succeeding term is elided, viz. इ or ई; in this case. बहु belongs to _Prithvadi_ class and takes इमन् affix. (V.1.122) The repetition of बहोः is for the sake of pointing out the _sthani_, for which the word भू is to be substituted : otherwise  भू would have replaced these affixes.
