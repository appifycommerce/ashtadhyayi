sutra: इष्ठस्य यिट् च
vRtti: बहोरुत्तरस्य इष्ठस्य यिडागमो भवति बहोश्च भूरादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After बहु, the augment यिट् is alled to इष्ठ, and भू replaces बहु ॥

---
As भूयिष्ठः ॥ This augment यिट् debars the _lopa_ substitution, of the last _sutra_, in the case of इष्ठ ॥ The इ in यिट् is for the sake of pronunciative, the augment being य ॥ Or इष्ठ may be taken to have lost its इ by the foregoing _sutra_, and to the ष्ठ, the augment यि may be added.
