sutra: ज्यादादीयसः
vRtti: ज्यादुत्तरस्य ईयस आकार आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: आ is substituted for the first letter of ईयस्, after ज्य ॥

As ज्यायान् ॥ ज्य is substituted for प्रशस्य by (5.3.61). '_Lopa_' being shut out by the intervening यिट् (6.4.159), the आत् is read in this _sutra_. If the _anuvritti_ of '_lopa_' were present here, then the अ of ज्य would be lengthened before यस् by (7.4.25), and we would get the form ज्यायान् ॥ The peculiar construction of this _sutra_ indicates the existence of the following maxim:- अङ्गवृत्ते पुनर्वृत्तावविधिः "when an operation which is taught in the _angadhikara_ (VI. 4, end-VII. 4, end) has taken place, and another operation of the _angadhikara_ is subsequently applicable, this latter operation is not allowed to take place." In (7.4.25), however, क्ङित् is understood, and lengthening could not have taken place by that rule.
