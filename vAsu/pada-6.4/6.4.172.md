sutra: कार्म्मस्ताच्छील्ये
vRtti: कार्म्म इति ताच्छील्ये टिलोपो निपात्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: कार्म is irregularly formed from कर्मन्, by the elision of the final अन्, when the sense is 'accustomed to such an occupation or prompt therein'.

This is formed by ण affix (IV.4.62). If this is the case, then by (VI.4.144), the form कार्म is regularly evolved. The fact is, that ण् and अण् affixes, in the sense of _tachchhilika_ are considered as one, and therefore (VI.4.167), would have prevented the elision of the final अन् syllable. In fact this proves the existence of the folloving maxim :- ताच्छीलिके णेऽण् कृतानि भवन्ति ॥ "The same operations which are occasioned by the addition of the affix अण्, take place, whenever the affix ण is added in the sense of one accustomed to that." Thus though ङीप् is added, to अण् - formed words, it is also added to ण - formed words, in the feminine: as चौरी; तापसी &c. The ण taught in (V.2.101), and (III.1.140), is excepted. Why do we say, having the sense of accustomed to that? Observe कर्मणः इदम् = कार्मणम् ॥
