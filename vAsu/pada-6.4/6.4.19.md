sutra: च्छ्वोः शूडनुनासिके च
vRtti: छ इत्येतस्य सतुक्वस्य वकारस्य च स्थाने यथासंख्यं श ऊठ् इत्येतावादेशौ भवतः, अनुनासिकादौ प्रत्यये परतः क्वौ झलादौ च क्ङितिः ॥
vRtti_eng: For च्छ् (including the augment तुक्) is substituted श्, and for व is substituted ऊठ्, before an affix beginning with a Nasal, as well as before क्वि and _jhaladi_ ङित् and कित् affixes (VI. 4. 15).

Thus प्रश्नः, विश्नः from प्रच्छ and विच्छ, with the affix नङ् (III.3.90) the च्छ being replaced by श ॥ Similarly from the root सिव् we have स्थोनः thus: सिव् + न (_Unadi_ III. 9). = सि + ऊ + न = स्थू + न = स्थोनः (VII.3.84). Here the ऊ is added to the stem prior to the scope being given to the _guna_ rule of (VII.3.86), otherwise the form would be सिव्  + न = सेव् + न = से + ऊ + न ॥ Having thus added ऊ, before scope could be given to the _guna_ rule (VII.3.86), we make _sandhi_ of सि + ऊ = स्थू, because semivowel substitution is _antaranga_ operation and of wider scope than _guna_, and the maxim of वार्णादाङ्ग बलीयो भवति has no scope here. "An operation which is taught in the _Angadhikara_, and affects the _anga_ or stem, possesses force than an operation which concerns a combination of letters (i. e. is taught in a _sandhi_ rule)".

With क्वि we have शब्दप्राश् formed with क्विप् (_Unadi_ 11.57 ) added to प्रच्छ, there is no vocalisation of the semivowel र, and there is lengthening of अ, and च्छ changed to श. So also गोविश् ॥

Of the change of व into ऊ we have the following :- अक्षद्यूः, हिरण्यद्यूः (दिव् + क्विप् = दि + ऊ = द्यूः) ॥ Here the ऊ substitution is _Bahiranga_, and दि + ऊ = द्यू, the change of इ into य is _antaranga_, therefore on the maxim of असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे (a _bahiranga_ is non-existent for the purposes of an _antaranga_); there should be no change of इ into य, for ऊ is non-existent. That maxim is however set aside by नाजानन्तर्ये बहिष्ट्व प्रक्लृप्तिः "A _bahiranga_ operation is not regarded as _bahiranga_, and consequently _asiddha_, when an _antaranga_ operation is to take effect, which depends on the immediate sequence of a vowel and something else".

So also before a _jhaladi_ affix; as प्रच्छ + क्त = पृष्टः, पृष्टवान् (क्तवतु), पृष्ट्वा (क्त्वा); here च्छ is changed to श, there is vocalisation by (VI.1.16), and श changed to ष by (VIII.2.36).

So also व is changed to ऊ as, द्यूतः, द्यूतवान्, द्यूत्वा ॥

When the affixes are not ङित् or कित्, the rule does not apply: as द्युभ्याम्, द्युभिः ॥ Some do not read the _anuvritti_ of कित् and ङित् into this _sutra_, and explain द्युभ्याम् and द्युभिः by (VI.1.131) : उ short being substituted for व of दिव् ॥

In "छशां ष" (VIII.2.36) the letter छ should not be taken, because by the force of the present _sutra_, श is ordained to come every where in the place of छ ॥

The indicatory ठ् in ऊठ् is for the sake of distinguishing this ऊ in _sutras_ like एत्ये धत्यूठ् सु (VI.1.89). In the _sutra_ वाह ऊंठ् (VI.4.132) there is also indicatory ठ् ॥
