sutra: हलः
vRtti: अङ्गावयवाद्धलो यदुत्तरं संप्रसारणं तदन्तस्याङ्गस्य दीर्घो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The long vowel is substituted for a vocalised half-vowel अ, इ and उ at the end of a stem, when it is preceded by a consonant which is a portion of the stem."

Both the words दीर्घ and अण् from (VI. 3. 111), and संप्रसारण from (VI. 3. 139) are understood here. Thus हूतः from ह्वा, जीनः from ज्या, संवीतः from व्या ॥ Why do we say 'preceded by a consonant'? Observe उतः and उतवान् from वेञ् ॥ Why do we say that the preceding consonant should be a portion of the stem? Observe निरुतम्, here र is not an integral part of the stem, but a portion of the _upasarga_ निर् and therefore उ is not lengthened. Why do we say 'at the end of a stem'? Observe विद्धः, विचितः from व्यध् and व्यच्; here the vowel इ is in the middle of the stem. Why do we say 'अ, इ and उ substitutes of semivowels'? Observe तृतीयः ॥ Here त्रि has been vocalised into तृ, ऋ being substituted for र् before the affix तीय (V. 2. 55). There ऋ will not be lengthened. Or the absence of lengthening in तृतीय is an irregularity countenanced by _Panini_ himself in _sutras_ like (II. 1. 30) &c. The word अङ्ग should be repeated in this _sutra_, first to qualify the word हल, and then to qualify the letters अ, इ and उ ॥
