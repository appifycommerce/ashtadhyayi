sutra: रञ्जेश्च
vRtti: रञ्जेश्च शपि परत उपधाया नकारस्य लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The nasal of रञ्ज is also elided before शप् ॥

---
As रजति, रजतः, रजन्ति ॥ The separation of this from the preceding is for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ in which the _anuvritti_ of _ranj_ only runs and not of _dans_ &c.
