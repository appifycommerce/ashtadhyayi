sutra: स्यदो जवे
vRtti: जवेऽभिधेये स्यद इति घञि निपात्यते । स्यन्देर्नलोपो वृद्ध्यभावश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: The word स्यद is formed by घञ् in the sense of 'speed'.
---
This word is derived from स्यन्द, the nasal is elided, and the _Vriddhi_ prohibited irregularly. Though the _ardhadhatuka_ affix घञ् causes here the elision of a portion of the root, viz of न् of स्यन्द्, yet rule (I. I. 4) does not apply here. That rule prohibits _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_, only in case of इक् vowels, here the _Vriddhi_ is prevented with regard to अ ॥ The prevention of this _Vriddhi_ is irregular and not governed by (I. I. 4). Thus गोस्यदः अश्वस्यदः meaning "cow-speed," "horse-speed." but तैलस्यन्दः, and घृतस्यन्दः meaning "dripping of oil or ghee".
