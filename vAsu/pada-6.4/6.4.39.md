sutra: न क्तिचि दीर्घश्च
vRtti: क्तिचि परतोऽनुदात्तोपदेशादीनामनुनासिकलोपो दीर्घश्च न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Before the affix क्तिच्, the above roots neither drop their nasal nor lengthen their root-vowel.
---
The above roots i. e. _anudattopadesa_, ending in a nasal, and वन and तनादि, do not lose their nasal before क्तिच्. Thus यन्ति꣡, तन्ति꣡, वन्ति꣡ ॥ The lengthening would have taken place by (VI. 4. 15), when the nasal was not elided : that also is prohibited.
