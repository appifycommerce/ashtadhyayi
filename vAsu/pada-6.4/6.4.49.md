sutra: यस्य हलः
vRtti: हल उत्तरस्य यशब्दस्यार्द्धधातुके लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When a consonant precedes the final य in a verbal stem, this य is elided also before an _ardhadhatuka_ affix.

Thus बेभिदिता, बेभिदितुम्, बेभिदितव्यम् from the Intensive stern बेभिद्य ॥ In the _sutra_ यस्य is given, which is the Genitive singular of य namely of the letters य् अ ॥ By the rule of अलोऽन्त्यस्य (I. 1. 52), the अ of य ought to be elided and not य्; but that rule is evidently inapplicable here, since the elision of अ would have taken place by the preceding rule : the present rule therefore teaches the elision of य (_ya_). Or the word हलः may be considered as in the ablative case, and then by (I. 1. 54), the first letter would be elided namely य ॥ Why have we taken [the two letters (संघात) conjointly viz.] य and not य्? Observe ईर्ष्यिता, मव्यिता, शुच्यिता from the simple roots ईर्ष्य्, मव्य्, and शुच्य् ॥ Here य् not being followed by अ, is not elided (see _Bhvadi_ 541-546). Why do we say "when preceded by a consonant?" Observe लोलूयिता, पोपूयिता ॥
