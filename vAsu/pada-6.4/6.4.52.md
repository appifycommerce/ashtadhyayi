sutra: निष्ठायां सेटि
vRtti: निष्ठायां सेटि परतोणेर्लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix णि is elided before the affixes क्त and क्तवतु when these take the augment इट् ॥

Thus कारितम्, हारितम्, गणितम्, लक्षितम् ॥ Why do we say "before an _ardhadhatuka_ affix having the augment इट्"? Observe संज्ञपितः पशुः ॥ This is the part participle of the causative, the इ being the sign of the causative. By (VII. 2. 15) read with (VII. 2. 49), ज्ञप् is a root which takes no इट् augment in the _Nishtha_. It may be objected that (VII. 2. 15) preventing इट् augment applies to verbs of one syllable (VII. 2. 10), and the causative ज्ञपि being of two syllables will always have इट् in the _Nishtha_, and so it is useless to use the word सेटि in the _sutra_. The word सेटि in the _sutra_ fixes the time when the elision of णि should take place. Namely, first there should be added the augment इट् and then, there should take place the elision of णि ॥ Otherwise we shall have this difficulty कारि + त, here let us elide the णि first : and we get कार् + त, now we cannot add इट् to त, for कार् being a verb of one syllable will not take इट् by (VII. 2. 10). Therefore, the reverse process must be adopted. We must elide इट् first. For ज्ञपितः see also (VII. 2. 27).
