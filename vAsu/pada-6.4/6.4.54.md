sutra: शमिता यज्ञे
vRtti: यज्ञकर्म्मणि शमितेति इडादौ णिलोपो निपात्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: शमिता is formed irregularly by the elision of णि before an इट् augmented affix, when meaning a sacrificial act.

Thus शृतं हविः शमितः ॥ It is formed by तृच् and is in the Vocative case. Why do we say 'when referring to a sacrificial act'? See शृतं हविः शमयितः ॥ See _Satpatha_ _Brahmana_ 3.8.3, 4 and 5.
