sutra: ल्यपि लघुपूर्वात्
vRtti: ल्यपि परतो लघुपूर्वादुत्तरस्य णेरयादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: अय् is substituted for the इ of णि, before the Absolutive affix ल्यप्, when the vowel preceding the इ is light.

Thus प्रशमय्य गतः, संदमय्य गतः, प्रवेभिदय्य, प्रगणय्य ॥ But प्रपात्य गतः the vowel preceding the इ being long. Here (VI. 4. 51) applies. The shortening, the elision of य and the elision of अ should not be considered as _asiddha_, as their place of operation is not the same. Thus शम् + णिच् = शामि; this आ is shortened by (VI. 4. 92), and we have शमि ॥ This shortening is not to be considered as _asiddha_, for if _asiddha_, there being no _laghu_ _purva_, the present rule would not apply. Similarly वेभिद्य is the Intensive root, its य is elided by (VI. 4. 49), this elision is not considered as _asiddha_, if it were _asiddha_, the इ of भि would not be _laghu_. Similarly the elision of अ in गण which is a root which ends in अ, (see _Dhatupatha_ _Churadi_ 309), is not considered as _asiddha_ for similar reasons.
