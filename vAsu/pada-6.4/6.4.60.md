sutra: निष्ठायामण्यदर्थे
vRtti: ण्यतः कृत्यस्यार्थो भावकर्म्मणी ताभ्यामन्यत्र या निष्ठा तस्यां क्षियो दीर्घो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A long is substituted for the इ of क्षि before the Participle in क्त, when it has not the sense of the future Passive Participle in ण्यत् ॥
---
The force of ण्यत् is to denote condition (Impersonal action) and object (passive). When the Past Participle has not the force of ण्यत्, the vowel of क्षि is lengthened. Thus आक्षीणः, प्रक्षीणः, परिक्षीणः all used in the active sense. The क्त is added to the Intransitive क्षि to denote the agent (III. 4. 72). Thus प्रक्षीणमिदं देवदत्तस्य 'this is the spot where _Devadatta_ perished'. Here क्त is used with a Locative force (III. 4. 76). Why do we say 'not having the force of ण्यत्?' Observe अक्षितमसिमामेक्षेष्ठाः ॥ Here त is added with the force of condition, and _akshitam_ means 'imperishable'. The vowel not being lengthened the त is not changed to म (VIII. 2. 46).
