sutra: दीङो युडचि क्ङिति
vRtti: दीङोयुडागमो भवति अजादौ क्ङिति प्रत्यये परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: युट् is the augment after दीङ्, of an _ardhadhatuka_ affix beginning with a vowel and having an indicatory क् or ङ् ॥

---
Thus उपदिदीये, उपदिदीयाते and उपदिदीयिरे ॥ The Personal ending is कित् by (I.2.5). दीङः being in the Ablative case, the augment is applied to the affix. This augment, however, is not to be considered as _asiddha_ (VI.4.22) for the purposes of semi-vowel substitution under (VI.4.82). If that substitution were allowed, the augment would become useless. Why before an affix having क् or ङ् ? Observe उपदानम् ॥
