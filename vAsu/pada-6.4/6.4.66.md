sutra: घुमास्थागापाजहातिसां हलि
vRtti: घुसंज्ञकानामङ्गानां मा स्था गा पा जहाति सा इत्येतेषां हलादौ क्ङिति प्रत्यये परत ईकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: For the final of the roots of the form of दा and धा (घु), as well as for that of the roots मा, स्था, गा, पा, हा (जहाति) and सा (सो), there is substituted ई before an _ardhadhatuka_ affix beginning with a consonant, which has an indicatory क् or ङ् ॥

Thus दीयते, धीयते with यक्, देदीयते, वेघीयते with यङ् ॥ So also मीयते मेमीयते स्थीयते, तेष्ठीयते, गीयते, जेगीयते, अध्यगीष्ट, अध्यगीषाताम्, अध्यगीषत, पीयते, पेपीयते, हीयते, जेहीयते, अवसीयते, अवसेसीयते ॥

The पा 'to protect' of _Adadi_ (47) is not meant here. become the _vikarana_ शप् is elided in roots of that class. Its form will be पायते. It is _Bhvadi_ पा 'to drink' that is taken here. So also हा – जिहीयते is not to be taken here. Its form is हायते ॥

Why do we say 'before a consonant'? Observe ददतुः, ददुः ॥ Here had हल् not been used in the _sutra_, the आ of दा would be replaced by ई by the present _sutra_, even before a vowel-affix अतु ० उस् ; for the _lopa_ of आ taught in (6.4.64) is prevented by this subsequent _sutra_  teaching ई substitution. In fact, the employment of the word हल् in the aphorism is a _jnapaka_ that the rule of _vipratishedha_ (1. 4. 2) applies in this section of _asiddha_ (6.4.22), and the _lopa_ of आ is superseded by the present rule substituting ई instead. So also दाता and धाता before non-कित् and non ङित् affixes.
