sutra: वाऽन्यस्य संयोगादेः
vRtti: घ्वादिभ्योऽन्यस्य संयोगादेराकारान्तस्य वा एकारादेशो भवति लिङि परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: For the final आ of any other root than those mentioned in (VI. 4. 66), ए may optionally be substituted, in the Benedictive active, when the root begins with a conjunct consonant.

The स्था was the only root of (6.4.66), which could have been affected by this rule. It has been, however, specially exempted by the word अन्यस्य ॥ Thus ग्लेयात् or ग्लायात्, म्लेयात् or म्लायात्, but only स्थेयात् (6.4.66), and यायात् (not commencing with a double consonant). The phrase क्ङिति is understood here and therefore the rule applies to _Parasmaipada_ affixes (3.4.104). Thus ग्लासिष्ट in _Atmanepada_. The root considered as an _anga_, should consist of a double consonant, therefore in निर्वायात् (from निर् + वा), र्व is not to be considered as a root having a double consonant, for र is no part of the _anga_, but of the preposition.
