Thus ऐक्षिष्ट, ऐक्षत, ऐक्षिष्यत; औव्जीत्, औव्जत्, औव्जिष्यत् ॥ ऐहिष्ट, ऐहत and ऐहष्य औम्भीत्, औम्भत्, and औम्भिष्यत् ॥ The _Vriddhi_ takes place by (VI. I. 90).

The Passive Imperfect (लङ्) of यज्, वप् and वह are ऐज्यत, औप्यत and औह्यत formed by आट् and not अट् ॥ First, the affixes of the Imperfect are added and then the Passive characteristic यक् is added to these roots, which causes the vocalisation of the semi-vovels, and we have इज्यत, उप्यत, and उह्यत stems (VI. 1. 15). The stems having now assumed a form in which they begin with a vowel, take आट् ॥ The addition of tense-affixes being an _antaranga_ operation precedes the addition of augment. After the affixes have been added, the _vikarana_ यक, being _nitya_, is added and precedes in order the augment, the latter being so far _anitya_; after यक् addition the roots assume a form in which we can add आट् ॥ Why आट् is considered _anitya_ depends on the following maxim :- शब्दान्तरस्य प्राप्नुवन् विधिरनित्यो भवति "when the word-form in reference to which a rule teaches something; after the taking effect of another rule that applies simultaneously would be different from what it was before that other rule had taken effect, then the former rule is not _nitya_."
