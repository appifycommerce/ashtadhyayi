Thus कं स्विद्गर्भं प्रथमं दध्रे आपः (_Rig_ X. 82. 5) या स्य परिदध्रे ॥ In दध्रे, the आ of धा is elided before the affix इरे by (VI.4.64), the रे substitution being considered as _asiddha_ (VI.4.22) for the purposes of the elision of आ ॥ Sometimes the substitution does not take place, as परमाया धियोग्निर्म्माणि चक्रिरे ॥ Here इट् augment is first added to रे after the सेट् roots and the affix thus becomes इरे, then रे is substituted again for this इरे by this _sutra_, thus the affix is brought back to its original condition. To show this repetition – रे – इरे – रे the _sutra_ has exhibited the word इरयोः in the dual number.
