sutra: हुश्नुवोः सार्वधातुके
vRtti: हु इत्येतस्याङ्गस्य श्नुप्रत्ययान्तस्यानेकाचोऽसंयोगपूर्वस्याजादौ सार्वधातुके परतो यणादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The semi-vowel व् is substituted for the उ of हु, and for that of नु (the characteristic of the fifth class roots), before a _sarvadhatuka_ affix (III. 4. 113) beginning with a vowel, when the stem consists of more than one syllable and the उ is not preceded by a conjunct consonant.

Thus हु – जुह्वति, जुह्वतु; अजुह्वन्, so also with सु – as सुन्वन्ति, सुन्वन्तु, असुन्वन् ॥ Why do we say "of हु and श्नु formed stems"? Observe योयुवति, रोरुवति, from Intensive bases, by the  elision of the यङ् affix, The यङ् is elided in the secular literature also, by the implication (_jnapaka_) of this aphorism, for no counter-example can be formed of a root consisting of more than one syllable and ending in उ, not preceded by a conjunct consonant and followed by a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix, unless the intensive roots with the elision of यङ् be taken. Nor can we get examples from the _Chhandas_, for the preceding rule applies only to _ardhadhatuka_ affixes. Why do we say before a _Sarvadhatuka_? Observe जुहुवतुः, जुहुवुः (VI. 4. 77). So also not in आप्नुवन्ति and राध्नुवन्ति as the उ is preceded by a conjunct consonant.
