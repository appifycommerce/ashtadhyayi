vRtti_eng: For the penultimate ओ of the _gunated_ stem गोह् (from गुह्), there is substituted ऊ before an affix beginning with a vowel.

Thus निगूहति, निगूहकः, साधुनिगूहिन्, निगूहम्, निगूहन्ति, गूहो वर्तते ॥ Why do we say 'penultimate'? So that the substitution should not apply any where else. The form गोह् is taken in the _sutra_ to prohibit the application of the rule to cases where गुह् does not assume the form गोह् ॥ Therefore not here, निजुगुहतुः, निजुगुहुः ॥ This change will not take place before the affixes beginning with a consonant; as निगोढा, निगोढुम् ॥ Some say, the word is exhibited as गोह in order to prohibit the अय् substitution of णि before ल्यप् ॥ As निगाहि + ल्यप् = निगूह्य ((VI.4.56) not applied), the ऊ substitution being considered as _asiddha_ (VI.4.22) would have brought in अय्, गूह् being considered as a word having a light vowel for its penultimate. According to _Kasika_ the ऊ substitution, however, is not _asiddha_, as their places of operation are different.
