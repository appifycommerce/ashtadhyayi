sutra: दोषो णौ
vRtti: दोष उपधाया ऊकार आदेशो भवति णौ परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The ओ of दोष् is replaced by ऊ before the causative णि ॥"
---
Thus दूषयति, दूषयतः, दूषयन्ति ॥ Similar reasons as in गोह, may be given for the root दुष being exhibited as दोष in the _sutra_. When not followed by णि, we have दोषो वर्त्तते ॥
