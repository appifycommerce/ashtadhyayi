sutra: चिण्णमुलोर्द्दीर्घोऽन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: चिण्परे णमुल्परं च णौ परतो मितामङ्गानामुपधाया दीर्घो भवति अन्यतरस्याम् ॥
vRtti_eng: "Optionally a long may be substituted for the penultimate of the causative of मित् roots, before the third person of the Passive Aorist in चिण् (इ), and before the Absolutive affix णमुल् (अम्) ॥"

Thus अशमि or अशामि, अतमि or अतामि with चिण्; and शमंशमम्, and शामंशामं; तमंतमम् or तामंतामम् with णमुल् ॥ Why have we used the word दीर्घ in the _sutra_? The rule does not teach merely the optional shortening. So that in the alternative of short, we have अशमि and in the other alternative we have अशामि, so that there is long. For had दीर्घ not been used, it would have taught optional short only, i. e. it would be a ह्रस्वविकल्पविधि only, and there will be this difficulty :- when the causative of causative is taken, as in शमयन्तं प्रयुङ्क्ते, there would not be lengthening in the alternative. Because the _lopa_ substitute of णि would be _sthanivat_ : therefore, the णि which would be followed by चिण् or णमुल्, would not have in it the मित् _anga_, because the first णि intervenes between the मित् _anga_ and the चिण् and णमुल् affix, and that णि which is preceded by a मित् _anga_ is not followed by चिण् and णमुल्, because the second णि (though elided) intervenes. Therefore, there would not be optional short here, but compulsory short, by the preceding _sutra_ and no lengthening. The rule, therefore, teaches the optional substitution of the long (दीर्घ). For there arises no such anomaly in this view. For taking this rule to be a दीर्घविधि, the _lopa_-substitution of णि would not be _sthanivat_, by the express prohibition contained in (l. 1. 58), and so we can get forms of double causatives. But if we take it a ह्रस्वविकल्पविधि, then the _lopa_-_adesa_ of णि being _sthanivat_, would prevent getting the alternative long form. Therefore the word दीर्घ is used in the _sutra_ to make this rule a दीर्घविधि, and prevent _sthanivat_-_bhava_. Thus take the causative of शम्, which will be शमि by the last _sutra_. Take its Intensive with यङ्, शमि + यङ् which causes doubling by (VI. 1. 9) = शमि शमि + यङ् = शशमि + यङ् (VII. 4. 60) = शं शमि + यङ् (नुक् or nasal being added to the _abhyasa_ by (VII. 4. 85)) = शंशमि + यङ् = शंशम् + य (VI. 4. 51) = शंशम्य. Add णिच् to this i. e. make the causative of the Intensive. शंशम् + य + इ ॥ Then the अ of य is elided by (VI. 4. 48) = शं शम् + य् + इ. Then य् is elided by (VI. 4. 49) = शंशम् + इ = शंशमि ॥ This शंशमि is the causative root of the Intensive of the causative शम् ॥ Now add चिण् or णमुल् to this root; and we get two forms short and long अशंशमि or अशंशामि with चिण् and शंशमम् or शंशामम् with णमुल् ॥ The long forms could not have been obtained had this not been a दीर्घविधि, for then the _lopa_-_adesa_ of णिच् being _sthanivat_ would have prevented the application of दीर्घ ॥ The roots शम् and तम् (both _Divadi_) ending in म् do not ever lengthen the root vowel before चिण् and णमुल् by (VII. 3. 34). The present _sutra_, therefore, does not apply to the simple roots. The derivative causative roots of these, namely, शमि - शमयति, तमि – तमयति, optionally lengthen the penultimate before these affixes. Thus शमि + चिण् = शम् + चिण् (the इ of णि being elided by VI. 4. 51) शामि or शमि (with the augment अ = अशामि or अशमि) ॥ This rule applies when the Causative of the Causative root takes these affixes. In fact, the mention of the word दीर्घ implies as much, otherwise the _sutra_ could have been made without this word, for the word 'optionally' would have brought in both 'short' and 'long'. Thus in शमयन्तं प्रयुङ्क्ते 'he causes another to make quiet,' we add णि (the Causative sign.), to the Causative root शमि, as शमि + णि = शम् + इ (VI. 4. 51) = शामि, the _lopadesa_ here is not _sthanivat_ for the purposes of lengthening (दीर्घविधि) the अ of शम् (I. 1. 58) ॥ From this शामि with चिण् we get अशामि, and with णमुल् we get शामम् ॥ But we cannot get the short forms, by taking the other alternative, as the _lopadesa_ will then be _sthanivat_. Hence the necessity of the word दीर्घ in the _sutra_. Thus the चिण् and णमुल् forms of the Causative of the Causative (i.e. the double Causative) of शम् are अशमि or अशामि; शमंशमम् or शामंशामम् and from the form शंशमयति, we have अशंशमि or अशंशामि, शंशमंशंशमम् or शंशामंशंशामम् ॥ These latter are from the Causative stems of the Intensive root. The sign यङ् of the Intensive has been elided (VI. 4. 49) as shown above.
