sutra: नेदमदसोरकोः
vRtti: इदम् अदस् इत्येतयोरककारयोर्भिस ऐस् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: This substitution of ऐस् does not take place after इदम् and अदस्, except when they end in क ॥

As एभिः, अमीभिः, but इमकैः, अमुकैः ॥ By (VII.2.102), अ is substituted for the final of इदम्, as इद + अ = इद (VI.1.97). By (VII.2.113), the इद् is elided before भिस्, and the only portion left is अ, which becomes ए according to (VII.3.103). For the final of अदस् is similarly by (VII.2.102), अ substituted, and अद + अ = अद (VI.1.97), and according to our present _sutra_, the form in Instrumental plural would be अदेभिः, but द् is changed to म् by (VIII.2.80), and ए to ई by (VIII.2.81).

The exception made with regard to these forms ending in क, shows the existence of the following maxim : तद्मध्यपतितस्तद्ग्रहणेन गृह्यते "Any term that may be employed in Grammar denotes not merely what is actually denoted by it, but it denotes also whatever word-form may result when something is inserted in that which is actually denoted by it."

The _sutra_ has not been made as इदमदसोः कात्, for had it been so constructed the rule would have applied to the क ending इदम् and अदस् and to no other क ending pronoun, and we could not get the forms सर्वकैः, विश्वकैः ॥  Moreover such a construction would have made ऐस् applicable to इदम् and अदस् also in their simple states : i. e. we could not have got the forms एभिः or अमीभिः ॥ Therefore the negative construction न अकोः is used in _sutra_ in order to prevent the rule of contrariety.
