sutra: ङेर्यः
vRtti: ङेरिति चतुर्थ्यकवचनस्य ग्रहणम् अकारान्तादङ्गादुत्तरस्य ङे इत्येतस्य य इत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a stem ending in अ, there is substituted य for the Dative ending ए ॥

Thus वृक्षाय, प्लक्षाय, the अ is lengthended by (VII.3.102), in spite of the maxim संनिपातलक्षणो विधि रनिमित्तम् तद्विधातस्य ॥ "That which is taught in a rule the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination". Thus य is substituted here, because the preceding word ends in a short अ, thus this short अ occasioned the existence of य, therefore this य cannot occasion the destruction of अ ॥  But that however it does, for it is on account of this य, that the preceding अ is replaced by आ ॥

The ङेः is the anomalous genitive case of the Dative ending ङे; this affix is exhibited without any _vibhakti_ in (VII.1.28). The ङेः should not be taken as the Genitive singular of ङि the affix of the Locative singular.
