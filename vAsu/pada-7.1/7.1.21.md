sutra: अष्टाभ्य औश्
vRtti: अष्टाभ्य इति कृताकारोऽष्टशब्दो गृह्यते तस्मादुत्तरयोर्जश्शसोरौशित्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After the stem अष्टा (the form assumed by अष्टन् (VII. 2. 84)), औश् is substituted for the endings of the Nominative and Accusative Plural."

As अष्टौ तिष्ठन्ति, अष्ठौ पश्य ॥ Why have we taken the form अष्टा and not अष्ट ? Observe अष्ट तिष्ठन्ति, अष्ट पश्य ॥ This peculiar construction of the present _sutra_ (अष्टाभ्यः instead of अष्टनः) indicates, that the आ substitution for the न् of अष्टन् is optional. This _sutra_ is, moreover, an exception by anticipation, to the following _sutra_, by which the plural Nominative and Accusative endings are elided after the numerals called षष् ॥ The elision of case-endings taught by (II. 4. 7I), is not, however, barred by this rule; the elision taught therein will take place, whether this rule applies or not. Thus अष्टपुत्रः, अष्टभार्यः ॥

The present rule applies even when अष्ट is at the end of a compound, as परमाष्टौ, उत्तमाष्टौ ॥ But in प्रियाष्टानः, औ does not come, as अष्टन् has not assumed the form अष्टा here i.e. it has not lost its न् ॥
