As दधि तिष्ठति, दधि पश्य, मधु तिष्ठति, मधु पश्य ॥ So also त्रपु and जतु ॥ In तद् ब्राह्मणकुलम् the word तद् has lost its nominative singular ending by this rule, which has thus superseded the subsequent rule (VII.2.102), by anticipation, by which अ replaces the final द् of तद् ॥ Or this _luk_ rule of the present _sutra_ is a _Nitya_ rule compared with (VII.2.102). How can this be a _nitya_ rule when it is set aside by the next rule अतोऽम् ॥ We still call this rule _nitya_, on the maxim यस्य च लक्षणान्तरेण निमित्तं विहन्यते न तदनित्यम् "(an operation) the cause of which would, (after the taking effect of another operation that applies simultaneously), be removed by another (third rule), is not, (on that account regarded as) not _nitya_". For here the cause which is _luk_-elision, is removed by the following aphorism अतोऽम् which ordains an अम् instead of _luk_, and not by (VII.2.102). For the application of rule (VII.2.102), the necessary condition is that a case-affix should follow तद् &c. But when the case-affix itself is _luk_-elided, the substitution taught in that _sutra_ cannot take place.
