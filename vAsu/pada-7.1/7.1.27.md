sutra: युष्मदस्मद्भयां ङसोऽश्
vRtti: युष्मदस्मदित्येताभ्यामुत्तरस्य ङसोऽशित्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: अश् (I. 1. 55), is substituted for the Genitive ending अस्, after युष्मद् and अस्मद् ॥

Thus तव and मम ॥ The indicatory श् of अश् shows that by (I.1.55), the whole of the affix अस् is to be replaced : otherwise it would have replaced only the first letter of the affix; and the affix not being a substitute-affix, rule (VII.2.89), would not be applicable to it. The तव is substituted for युस्मद्, and मम for अस्मद् by (VII.2.96); and तव + अ (अश्), and मम + अ = तव and मम् by (VI. I. 97).
