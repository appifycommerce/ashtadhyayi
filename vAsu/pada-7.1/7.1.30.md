sutra: भ्यसो भ्यम्
vRtti: युष्मदस्मद्भ्यामुत्तरस्य भ्यसो भ्यमित्ययमादेशो भवतिः ॥
vRtti_eng: अभ्यम् is substituted for the Dative भ्यस् after '_yushmad_' and '_asmad_.'

As युष्मभ्यम् and अस्मभ्यम् ॥ As the _sutra_ is constructed (भ्यसो भ्यम्) it is not easy to say whether the substitute is भ्यम् or अभ्यम् ॥ If it is भ्यम्, then we have two cases, (1) eliding the final द् of _yushmad_ and _asmad_, by (VII.2.90); and adding भ्यम् (2) eliding अद् of _yushmad_ and _asmad_¬ by (VII.2.90), and adding भ्यम् ॥ It will be shown hereafter that (VII.2.90), is capable of two explanations, one by which _yushmad_ and _asmad_ lose their द् only, and by another अद् ॥ Similarly with  अभ्यम् we have also two cases : Thus we have four cases, as (1) _yushma_ + _bhyam_, (2) _yushm_ + _bhyam_, (3) _yushma_ + _abhyam_, (4) _yushm_ + _abhyam_. In the case of the first (_yushma_ + _bhyam_) we can get the proper form, though it may be objected that _yushma_ + _bhyam_ should be equal to युष्मेभ्यम् by (VII.3.103): this ए substitution will not take place, however, by force of the maxim अङ्गवृत्त पुनर्वृत्तावविधिर्निर्दिष्ठितस्य "when an operation which is taught in the _angadhikara_ has taken place, and another operation of the _angadhikara_ is subsequently applicable, this latter operation is not allowed to take place."

The second case is an impossibility, namely, _yushm_ + _bhyam_ can give us no form. The third case _yushma_ + _abhyam_ will give us the proper form  युष्म꣡भ्यम् (अ + अ = अ by (VI.1.97)). Moreover the accent also will be on the middle युष्मभ्यम् by (VI.1.161), the _udatta_ अ of _yushma_ being elided by the _anudatta_ अ of अभ्यम्, the acute will be on the _anudatta_ अ ॥ It should not be objected that in (VI. I. 161), the word अन्त of (VI.1.159) is understood, and the accent will be on the final. We have shown in that _sutra_, that the _udatta_ will fall on the आदि (beginning) of the _anudatta_ term which causes the elision. The fourth alternative _yushm_ + _abhyam_ is free from all objections.
