sutra: आत औ णलः
vRtti: आकारान्तादङ्गादुत्तरस्य णल औकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "औ is substituted for णल्, the affix of the first and third person singular of the perfect, after roots ending in long आ ॥"

Thus पपौ, तस्थौ, जग्लौ, मम्लौ, from पा, स्था, ग्लै (ग्ला) and म्लै (म्ला) ॥ The form पपौ is thus evolved, पा + णल् = पा + अ ॥ Here three operations simultaneously present themselves for application, namely; 1. Reduplication, 2. Lengthening; by the single substitution of one long vowel आ, for आ + अ; and 3. The substitution of औ for आ by the present _sutra_. In what order should these operations be then performed? First the affix अ should be replaced by औ, then the single substitution of औ for आ + औ ; and then treating it as _sthanivat_, and then reduplication. For if the single substitution of आ for आ + अ had taken place first, then there would be no scope for औ substitution, therefore the औ substitution, should take place first. Thus we have पा + औ = पौ; this _vriddhi_-_ekadesa_, is treated as _sthanivat_ by (I. 1. 59), and it causes reduplication. The _vriddhi_-_ekadesa_ should first take place (i. e. आ + औ = औ) and then the reduplication, because the former rule is subsequent to the latter.
