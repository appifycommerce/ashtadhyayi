sutra: तुह्योस्तातङाशिष्यन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: तु हि इत्येतयोराशिषि विषये तातङ्गादेशो भवत्यन्यतरस्याम् ॥
vRtti_eng: तातङ् is optionally substituted for the affixes तु and हि of the Imperative, when benediction is meant.

---
As जीवताद् भवान्, जीवतात् त्वम्, जीवतु भवान्, जीव त्वम् ॥ The ङ् prevents _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_, (I.1.4), and the substitute replaces the whole affix ((I.1.53) notwithstanding). The substitute is not _sthanivat_ पित्, though it replaces a पित् affix, because it has its own indicatory letter ङ्, and ङित् does not become पित्; and consequently in ब्रूतात् ई is not added to the affix, by (VII.3.93). ई being added only to पित् affixes after ब्रू ॥ When not denoting benediction, we have not this substitution : as ग्रामं गच्छतु भवान् or गच्छ ग्रामम् ॥

The affix तातङ् being a substitute of हि, is like हि, and, therefore, rules propounded with regard to हि, will apply to तातङ् also. Thus (VI.4.105) says that after stems ending in short अ, the हि is elided: therefore, after such words तातङ् should also be elided. Therefore we cannot get the form जीवतात् त्वम् for जीवत्वम् ॥ This objection, however, is futile; for, in the _sutra_ अतो हे (V1. 4. 105), there is the _anuvritti_ of हि from _sutra_ (VI.4.101) (हु झलभ्यो हेर्द्धिः) ॥ So that अतो हे should be construed as meaning "there is the elision of हि when it is of the form हि, and not when it assumes the form तातङ्" ॥

The object of ङ् in तातङ् is, as we have said above, for the sake of preventing _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_. It should not be said that the object of ङ् in तातङ् is for the sake of अन्त्यविधिः by the application of _sutra_ ङिच्च (1. 1. 53), just as the substitutes अनङ् &c (VII.1.93) and (VII.1.94) apply to the finals. For by so doing, तातङ् would replace only the उ of तु and the इ of हि, which is not desired. And the case of तातङ् is to be distinguished from अनङ्, for in अनङ् the ङ् has no other object but to prevent _sarvadesa_; but in तातङ् we see that ङ् has another object, namely, the prevention of _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_ ; and ङ् having thus found scope, the तातङ् substitute will be governed by the general rule अनेकाल् शित् सर्वस्य (I.1.55).

The _Karika_ given below raises these points.

_Karika_ :-

तातङि ङित्त्वं संक्रमकृत्स्यादन्त्यविधिश्चेत्तच्च तथा न ।
हेरधिकारे हेरधिकारो लोपविधौ तु ज्ञापकमाह ॥
तातङो ङित्त्वसामर्थ्यान्नायमन्त्यविधिः स्मृतः ।
न तद्वदनङादीनां तेन तेऽन्त्यविकारजाः ॥

_Karika_:- In तातङ् the ङ् is for the sake of preventing _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_ (संक्रम = गुणवृद्धिप्रतिषेधः)॥ If it be said, it is for the sake of अन्त्यविधि by (I.1.53); we say it is not so. (If you say that after roots ending in short अ, तात् should be elided, by (VI.4.105) read with (I.1.56), we reply): when the _anuvritti_ or _adhikara_ of हि was already existent in the _sutra_ (VI.4.105) from _sutra_ (VI.4.101), the express employment of हि in (VI.4.105), indicates that the _lopa_ rule does not apply to तातङ् ॥ (The _lopa_-rule not applying to तातङ्, it follows that it replaces the whole of हि and not only its final). The ङ् in तातङ् finds its scope in preventing _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_, therefore, it is not for the sake of _antya_ _vidhi_ (I.1.53). The ङित्व in अनङ् &c has no other scope, therefore, these substitutes replace the final only.
