sutra: शीङो रुट्
vRtti: शीङोङ्गादुत्तरस्य झादेशस्यातो रुडागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The अत् substitute of झ्, gets the augment रुट्, after the root शी ॥

---
Thus शेरते, शेरताम्, अशेरत ॥ The augment र् is added at the beginning of the affix, making अत् = रत् ॥ Had this र् been an augment of झ, then like the आट् augment in शयान्तै, it would have intervened between the शी and झ, and झ not immediately following a non-अ stem, अत् would not have been substituted for झ at all. Therefore रुट् is made the augment of the substitute अत, and not of झ ॥ The root शी is read in the _sutra_ with its _anubandha_ ङ् in order to indicate, that there is no रुट् augment when there is elision of the Intensive affix यङ्, nor any _Guna_. As व्यति शेश्यते ॥

It is a general rule that an operation applying to a root which is exhibited with an _anubandha_, will not apply to the same root in its Intensive-_yan_-_luk_ form. The following verse shows when operations applying to simple roots will not apply to their Intensive forms:--

श्तिपा शपानुबन्धेन निर्दिष्टं यद्गणेन च ।
यत्रैकाज् ग्रहणं चैव पंचैतानि न यङ्लुकि ॥

"These five sorts of operations will not apply to Intensive-_yan_-_luk_ forms: 1. When the simple root is exhibited in the _sutra_ with श्तिप् as भू in (VII.4.73) is shown as भवति ॥ In Intensive, the perfect will be बोभवाञ्चकार and not बभवाञ्चकार ॥ 2. Where the root is exhibited with शप्, as the root भृ in (VII.2.49) is shown as भर ॥ There is इट् after the Desiderative of simple root but not in Intensive. 3. When a simple root is exhibited with an _anubhandha_, as शीङ् here. 4. Where a _gana_ is mentioned in a rule, as श्यन् is taught after _Divadi_-roots (III.1.69). It will apply to simple roots of _Divadi_ _gana_, and not to their Intensive. 5. Lastly, where the word एकाच् is used in a _sutra_. As (VII.2.10). That rule will apply to एकाच् simple roots and not to their Intensives.
