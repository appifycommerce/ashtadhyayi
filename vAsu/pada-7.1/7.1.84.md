As द्यौः ॥ There is a nominal-stem दिव् which is taken here. It has no indicatory letters annexed to it. The root दिव् is not to be taken here, as it has the indicatory letter उ and is exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ as  दिवु ॥ The nominal-stem derived from दिवु, does not take औ, but ऊ, the Nominative Singular of which is द्युः as अक्षद्युः (See (VI. 4. 19), and (VI. 1. 131).
