vRtti: पथ्यादीनां भसंज्ञकानां टेर्लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The last vowel, with the consonant that follows it, is dropped in _pathin_, _mathin_ and _rbhukshin_, before a weak case-ending beginning with a vowel (before which the stem is called _Bha_ (I. 4. 18)).

As पथः, पथा, पथे, मथः, मथा, मथे, ऋभुक्षः, ऋभुक्षा, ऋभुक्षे ॥ The _anuvritti_ of _sarvanamasthana_, of course, is inappropriate here: though its _anuvritti_ is current as will be seen in the next _sutra_.
