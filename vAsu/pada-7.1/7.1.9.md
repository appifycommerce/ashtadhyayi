_Karika_

एत्वं भिसि परत्वाश्चेदत ऐस्क्व भविष्यति ।
कृतेप्येत्वे भौतपूर्व्यादैस्तु नित्यस्तथा सति ॥

As वृक्षैः, प्लक्षैः, अतिजरसैः ॥ Why do we say ending in अ? Observe अग्निभिः, वायुभिः ॥ Why 'short अ'? Observe खट्वाभिः, मालाभिः ॥  The _adhikara_ of "अतः" ('after a short अ'), extends up to (VII. 1. 17).

The form अतिजरसैः illustrates some important principles of grammar.  अति + जरा = (जरामतिक्रान्तः) अतिजर (अ being shortened by (I. 2. 48)). The word अतिजर ends in अ, and there fore forms its Instrumental plural by ऐस् ॥ Thus अतिजर + ऐस् ॥ Now we apply (VII. 2. 101), which says for जरा is substituted जरस् before vowel-beginning case-endings. It should not be objected, that the substitution is ordained for जरा and not जर; for the maxim एकदेशविकृतमनन्यवद् भवति (a tail-less dog is still a dog) applies here. Having made this substitution, we get अतिजरसैः ॥ Nor should you object that it was the अ of जर which had given occasion to the existence of ऐस्, and that अ should not be destroyed, on the maxim संनिपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद् विघातस्य, for this maxim is not universal, as _Panini_ himself shows in employing the form कष्टाय (III. I. 14), in which ए of the Dative is changed into य by (VII. 1. 13), and then this very य causes the destruction of अ and makes it आ (See (VII. 1. 13) also).

_Karika_:- If there be substitution of ए for the final  अ before the affix भिस् by the subsequent _sutra_ (VII. 3. 103), where will then the present _sutra_, causing the substitution of ऐस् for भिस् after stems ending in अ, find its scope, (because there will be no stem left ending in अ)? If even after changing अ into ए, you change the भिस् into ऐस्, because the ए was once अ (भौतपूर्व्यात्); then the rule of changing भिस् into ऐस् becomes a _nitya_ rule, because it takes effect even after the application of rule (VII. 3. 103), and being _nitya_ it debars that rule. Thus वृक्ष + भिस् ॥ Here the subsequent rule (VII. 3. 103), requires the अ to be changed into ए ॥ Thus वृक्षे + भिः Now the present rule cannot apply because there is no अदन्त stem. However, is considering that वृक्षे once was अदन्त, we change भिः to ऐस् then the rule becomes a _nitya_ rule. In fact, it is a _nitya_ rule and debars the application of (VII. 3. 103), within its jurisdiction, (VII. 3. 103), finds its scope in वृक्ष + सु = वृक्षेषु ॥
