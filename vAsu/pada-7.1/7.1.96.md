sutra: स्त्रियां च
vRtti: असर्वनामस्थानार्थमारम्भः । स्त्रियां च क्रोष्टुशब्दस्य तृज्वद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The word क्रोष्टु is treated as if it ended in तृच्, in the feminine, before all case-endings."

This _sutra_ is commenced for the sake of cases other than strong ones. In strong cases, whether of masculine or feminine, the former _sutra_ applies; but in the feminine, in other cases also there is _trich_-treatment. Thus क्रोष्ट्री꣡, क्रोष्ट्री꣡भ्याम्, क्रोष्ट्रीभिः ॥ Some read the word क्रोष्टु in the _Gauradi_ class (IV. 1. 41), and they treat it is a तृच् ending word before the feminine affix ङीष्, as क्रोष्ट्रा ॥ According to them, in forming the _Taddhitartha_ compounds like पञ्चभिः क्रोष्ट्रीभिः क्रीतैः = पञ्चक्रोष्टृभी रथैः, we could not get the form पञ्चक्रोष्टृभिः, because when the affix ठक् is elided by (V. 1. 28), the feminine is also elided by (I. 2. 49), and the ङीष् being thus _luk_-elided, there would be no तृज्वद्भाव, because the affix leaves no trace behind (I. 1. 63). To get out of the difficulty, we can only say, that the form is so, in spite of the apparent inconsistency.

Those who do not read क्रोष्टु in the _Gauradi_ class, they explain this _sutra_ by saying that the word स्त्रियां indicates the sense, namely, क्रोष्टु is treated like a तृच् word, when it denotes a female, wherever it may occur.

And because क्रोष्टु is treated as if it was क्रोष्टृ, the feminine will be formed by the affix ङीप् by (IV. 1. 5), and the form क्रोष्ट्री꣡ will be end-acute by (VI. 1. 174). So that whether क्रोष्ट्री be formed by ङीष् under _Gauradi_ class, or by ङीप् under (IV. 1. 5), the accent remains the same: while under this second view, we have not to face any such difficulty as in the first.
