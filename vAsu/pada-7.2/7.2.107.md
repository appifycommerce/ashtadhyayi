_Karika_

अदसः सोर्भवेदौत्वं किं सुलोपो विधीयते ।
ह्रस्वाल्लुप्येत संबुद्धिर्न हलः प्रकृतं हि तत् ॥
आप एत्वं भवेत्तस्मिन्न झलीत्यनुवर्तनात् ।
प्रत्ययस्थाश्च कादित्वं शीभावश्च प्रसज्यते ॥

As अदस् + सु = अद + औ + सु (VII.2.107) = अस + औ (VII.2.166) = असौ ॥ 

Vart:- When the augment अकच् is added, the औ substitution is optional, and in that alternative उ is added after स्, as असुकः or असकौ ॥

Vart:- When त्यद् &c. form second members of a compound, the above mentioned substitutions take place before the application of _sandhi_: as परमाहम्, परमायम्, परमानेन ॥

The form असुकः is thus evolved :- अदकस् + सु, now औ substitution of the present _sutra_ is prohibited; therefore, the अ substitution of (VII.2.102) takes place, and the द् is changed to स् by (VII.2.106), and the अ of अकच् after स् is changed to उ ॥

The following observations may be made with regard to the forms परमाहम् &c. A substitute would be a _bahiranga_ with regard to a case-affix that should be added to a compound. Therefore, being an _antaranga_ rule, the _ekadesa_ should be made first, and this _ekadesa_ being considered as the beginning of the subsequent word, we should get erroneous forms like परमहम्, परमयं instead of परमाहम् and परमायम् &c. Hence the necessity of the above _vartika_.

_Karika :- Let the _sutra_ be अदस औ without the words सुलोपश्च ॥ The word सौ is understood here from the preceding aphorism. The word अदसः is in the ablative case, the word सौ which is in the 7th case, should be changed here into the 6th case सोः ॥ The _sutra_ would then mean अदस उत्तरस्य सोरौकारो भवति – औ is substituted for the सु after अदस् ॥ Then the final अस् of अदस् is changed to अ by (VII.2.102), and द् is changed to स् by (VII.2.106), and we have असौ ॥ So where is the necessity of using the words सुलोपश्च in the _sutra_.

Objection:- If औ be substituted for सु, then in the vocative this औ should be elided by (VI.1.69), as it comes after a short vowel अ of (VII.2.102). Answer:- औ will not be elided by (VI.1.69), for that rule refers to the elision of a consonantal affix only, the word हलः being understood in that _sutra_, from the preceding _sutra_ (VI.1.68).

Objection:- If this be so, then in the Feminine Vocative we have असा + औ, and by the rule (VII.3.106), the आ should be changed to ए before this औ ॥ Answer:- No, this will not be so, for the द substitution takes place only before a झल् beginning affix, for the word झलि is understood in the _sutra_ (VII.3.106) from the _sutra_ (VII.3.103).

Objection:- If this be so, then in the feminine with अकच्, we have, असका + औ, and here rule (VII.3.41) shows itself and requires the अ of स to be changed to इ (असिका) before the क of an affix. Answer:- That rule (VII.3.44) applies where the feminine affix आ is audible and remains unchanged, but here it is changed to औ (_Vrddhi_ अ । + औ = औ) in असकौ ॥

Objection:- But then in असा + औ, the औ would require to be changed to शी by (VII.1.18). Answer:- This objection is partial only, for औङ् in (VII. I. 18) is explained by some, to be the common name given by ancient grammarians to the औ of Dual; and not to this औ; moreover, in masculine no objection can apply. Hence the words सुलोपश्च may well be omitted.
