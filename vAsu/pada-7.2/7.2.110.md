sutra: यः सौ
vRtti: इदमो मकारस्य यकारादेशो भवति सौ परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: य् is substituted for the द् of इदम् in the Nominative Singular in the feminine.

As इयम् ॥ This is confined to the Feminine, as the following _sutra_ relates to the masculine; and in the Neuter, the सु is लुक् elided by स्वमोर्नपुंसक and so leaves no trace behind.
