sutra: हलि लोपः
vRtti: हलादौ विभक्तौ परत इदमोऽककारस्य इद्रूपस्य लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The इद् of इदम् is elided before a case-affix beginning with a consonant."

As आभ्याम्, एभिः, (VII. I. 11) एभ्यः एषाम्, एषु ॥ For म् is substituted अ by (VII. 2. 102), and for अ + अ = अ by (VI. I. 97). The rule: (I. I. 52) by which a substitute replaces only the final letter, does not apply here, on the maxim मानर्थके अलोऽन्त्यविधिः ॥ For no purpose is served by eliding merely the final म् of इदम् ॥ Hence इद् is elided. Or it may be said that the _sutra_ does not teach the elision of इद्, but of अन् which was substituted for इद् by the preceding _sutra_.
