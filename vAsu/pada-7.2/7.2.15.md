sutra: यस्य विभाषा
vRtti: यस्य धातोर्विभाषा क्वचिदिडुक्तस्तस्य निष्ठायां परत इडागमो न भवति ।
vRtti_eng: The Participial-affixes do not take इट्, after those roots, to which another suffix can optionally be added, with or without this augment इ ॥

That is, a root which is optionally Set, before other affixes, is invariably _anit_ before _Nishtha_. Thus by (VII.2.44), वल् consonant beginning affixes are optionally सेट् after the roots धू &c. The _Nishtha_ after धू &c, will be invariably _anit_. Thus विधूतः, विधूतवान्; गूढः, गूढवान् ॥ By (VII.2.56), the roots having an indicatory उ, optionally are followed by Set क्त्का ॥ The _Nishtha_ after उदित् roots will invariably be _anit_ : as वृद्धः, वृद्धवान् ॥

By the _vartika_ तानि पदि दरिद्राणामुपसंख्यानम् the roots तन्, पत and दरिद्रा take optional इट् in the Desiderative (VII.2.49). Though पत् is a root which thus optionally takes इट् in the Desiderative , yet its _Nishtha_ is always सेट्, for _Panini_ himself has employed the word पतित in _Sutra_ (II.1.24), (II.2.38). According to _Padamanjari_ this rule of यस्य विभाषा  is _anitya_ and not of universal application. Because had this rule been of universal application then the root कृत which is optionally _anit_ by (VII.2.57), would universally _anit_ by the present _sutra_ : and there would be no necessity of reading it with a long ई in the _Dhatupatha_, as कृती छेदने (VI. 141) to make its _nishtha_ _anit_ under (VII.2.14).
