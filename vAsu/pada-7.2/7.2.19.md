As धृष्टः, विशस्तः ॥ The root धृष् is exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ as ञिधृषा 'to be impudent' (V. 2 2), and as it has an indicatory आ, its past participle would be अनिट् by (7.2.16). शस् is शसु in the _Dhatupatha_ (1.763), and as it has an indicatory उ by (7.2.56). read with (7.2.15), its _Nishtha_ is also _Anit_. The special mention of these roots here, is for the sake of making a _niyama_ rule; namely, अनिट् only then when meaning 'impudent', and सेट् in other senses : as धर्षितः, विशसितः "धृष् never forms past participle with the force of भाव (Impersonal action) or आदिकर्म (beginning of action), and therefore (7.2.17) cannot apply to it" - _This is _Kasika_. According to _Bhattoji_ _Dikshit_ who quotes _Haradatta_ and _Madhava_, धृष् forms participles in those senses, when option is allowed, as, धृष्टं or धर्षितं, प्रधृष्टः or प्रधर्षितः not meaning 'impudent'.
