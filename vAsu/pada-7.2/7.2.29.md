As हृष्टानि लोमानि or हृषितानि लोमानि; हृष्टाः केशाः or हृषिताः केशाः, हृष्टं or हृषितं लोमभिः or केशैः ॥ हृषु 'to lie' (I. 741) is exhibited with an indicatory उ in the _Dhatupatha_, and would have been consequently always _anit_, in the _Nishtha_ (VII. 2. 15) because it was optionally _anit_ before _ktva_ (VII. 2. 56) hence this rule. ह्रष् 'to be delighted' (IV. 119) is also included here, this verb is सेट् ॥ The option appertains to both these verbs. The word लोम means the hair of the body as well as of the head : as in the sentence लोमनखं स्पृष्ट्वा शौचं कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ The sense of हृष् in connection with लोम or will be that of bristling up, horipillation. Why do we say "in connection with लोम?" Observe हृष्टो (_bhuadi_) देवदत्तः 'the deceived _Devadatta_' and ह्रषितो (_Divadi_) देवदत्तः 'the delighted _Devadatta_'.

Vart:- The option is allowed also in the senses of 'astonished' and 'beaten back', as ह्रष्टो or हृषितो देवदत्तः 'the astonished _Devadatta_'. हृष्टाः or हृषिता दन्ताः 'the bent or destroyed teeth'.
