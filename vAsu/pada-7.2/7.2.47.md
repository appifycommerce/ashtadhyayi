sutra: इण्निष्ठायाम्
vRtti: निरः कुषो निष्ठायामिडागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The augment इट् is added to the Participial affixes त and तवत्, after कुष् preceded by निर् ॥

---
As निष्कुषितवान्, निष्कुषितः ॥ The special mention of इट् in the _sutra_ is for the sake of making its addition invariable, otherwise it would have been
optional, or debarred by (7.2.15). In the subsequent _sutra_, the addition becomes again optional.
