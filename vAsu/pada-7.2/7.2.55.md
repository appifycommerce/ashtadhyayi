sutra: जॄव्रश्चोः क्ति
vRtti: जॄ व्रश्चि इत्येतयोः क्त्वाप्रत्यये इडागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _ktva_ takes the augment इट्, after जॄ and व्रश्च् ॥

As जरित्वा or जरीत्वा, (VII.2.38) and व्रश्चित्वा ॥ जॄ was prohibited by (VII.2.11). and व्रश्च would have been optionally सेट्, as it has an indicatory long ऊ, by (VII.2.44). Hence this rule. The special mention of _ktva_, stops the _anuvritti_ of _kta_ and _ktavatu_.
