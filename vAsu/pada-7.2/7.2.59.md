sutra: न वृद्भ्यश्चतुर्भ्यः
vRtti: वृतादिभ्यश्चतुर्भ्य उत्तरस्य सकारादेरार्द्धधातुकस्य परस्मैपदेषु इडागमो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Parasmaipada_ _ardhadhatuka_ affixes beginning with स् do not get the augment इट् after वृत् and the three roots that follow it.

---
Thus वृत् – वर्त्स्यति, अवर्त्स्यत्, विवृत्सति । वृध् वर्त्स्यति, अवर्त्स्यत् । विवृत्स्सति । शृधू । शर्त्स्यति । अशर्त्स्यत् । शिशृत्सति । स्यन्दू । स्यन्त्सति । अस्यन्त्स्यत् ।

The वृतादि roots are four वृत्, वृध्, शृध् and स्यन्द (_Bhuadi_ 795-798). In the examples, the _Parasmaipada_ forms are shown, because these roots are optionally _Parasmaipadi_ by (I.3.92) before स्य and सन् ॥

Objection :- The word चतुर्भ्यः may conveniently have been omitted from the _sutra_. A reference to the _Dhatupatha_ will show that the वृतादि roots form a subdivision of द्युतादि roots, and stand at the end of _Dyutadi_ class. So that the _sutra_ न वृद्भ्यः would have been enough, and there would have been no uncertainty or vagueness about it, for the word वृतादि would mean 'the roots वृत् &c. with which the _Dyutadi_ class ends'. Thus we shall get the five roots 795 वृतुर्वर्तने 796 वृधु वृद्धौ, 797 शृधु शब्दकुत्सायाम्; 798 स्यन्दू प्रस्रवणे and कृपू सामर्थ्ये ॥ As regards the last root कृपू, we shall find from the next _sutra_, that the present _sutra_ applies to this root also. Or we can change the order of the roots, putting  कृपू first, and वृतु &c after it, so that वृतादि will mean four roots only. Whether _vritadi_ be taken to mean the five or the four roots, the word चतुर्भ्यः is redundant.

Ans:- The word चतुर्भ्यः is used in order that the prohibition contained in this _sutra_ may debar the 'option' which the root स्यन्दू would have taken, because of its indicatory long ऊ (VII.2.44). For this 'option' is an _antaranga_ operation, because it applies to all _ardhadhatuka_ affixes; while the 'prohibition' of the present _sutra_ is a _bahiranga_, because it applies to those affixes only which begin with स ॥ So that the 'prohibition' of this _sutra_ would not have debarred the 'option' of (VII.2.44): and in the _Parasmaipada_ स्यन्दू would have had two forms; which, however, is not the case because of the word चतुर्भ्यः by which the 'prohibition' is extended to स्यन्दू also. Thus in the _Parasmaipada_, we have only one form, as, स्यन्त्स्यति; but in the _Atmanepada_ we have two forms स्यन्दिष्यते or स्यन्त्स्यते ॥

The word '_Parasmaipada_' is understood in this _sutra_, so that the prohibition does not apply to _atmanepada_ affixes: as वर्त्तिषीष्ट, वर्तिष्यते, अवर्तिष्यत्, विवर्तिष्यते, स्यन्दिषीष्ट or स्यन्त्सीष्ट ॥ Moreover, with regard to _Atmanepada_ also, the इट् is added to these roots when they stand in the same '_pada_' with the affixes. But when the _Atmanepada_ affixes are added not to the roots '_vrit_ &c', but to the roots which are derived from the nominal bases formed from '_vrit_ &c', then the 'root' is not in the same _pada_ with the affix, and the prohibition of this _sutra_ will apply. As विवृत्सित्रीयते ॥ Moreover, the rule applies, as we have said, to the affixes standing in the same '_pada_' with the 'roots'; therefore it will apply to Desiderative roots, as विवृत्सति, though शप् here intervenes between the _ardhadhatuka_ affix सन् and the _Parasmaipada_ तिप्; so also, an _ekadesa_ though _sthanivat_ and therefore an intervention, will not be considered so for the purposes of this rule, as विवृत्सिष्यति; so also in विवृत्सयति ॥ This prohibition, moreover, applies to कृत् affixes, and where there is _luk_-elision of _Parasmaipada_ affixes. As विवृत्सिता; and विवृत्स त्वम् where the Imperative हि is _luk_ elided, and being so elided, the force of _Parasmaipada_ does not here remain by न लुमताङ्गस्य (I.1.63); hence the above _Ishti_.
