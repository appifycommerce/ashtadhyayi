sutra: ऋतो भारद्वाजस्य
vRtti: ऋकारान्ताद्धातोर्भारद्वाजस्याचार्यस्य मतेन तासाविव नित्यानिटस्थलि इडागमो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the opinion of _Bharadvaja_, it is only after a root which ends in short ऋ, and after which the Periphrastic Future तास् is always devoid of the augment इट्, that थल् also, like तास्, does not take the augment इट् ॥

As स्मर्त्ता, सस्मर्थ, ध्वर्त्ता, दध्वर्थ ॥ The ऋ roots are covered by (7.2.61); the specification of these roots makes a restriction, so that all other roots, are not _anit_, though the Periphrastic Future in तास् be _anit_. So that according to _Bharadwaja_, we have forms like ययिथ, वयिथ, पेचिथ, शेकिथ ॥ Thus this _sutra_ makes the preceding two _sutras_ optional, except so far as short ऋ-ending roots are concerned.

As a general rule, all roots ending in long ॠ are सेट्; therefore, the _sutra_ mentions short ऋ, in order to debar its application to long ॠ ending words. Had it not been so, this rule would have been a _vidhi_ rule and not a _niyama_: because rule (7.2.61) does not apply to long ॠ ending roots, and so if the present _sutra_ were to include long ॠ also, it could not be called a _niyama_ (restriction) of (7.2.61).
