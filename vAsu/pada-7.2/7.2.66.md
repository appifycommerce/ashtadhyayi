As आदिथ, आरिथ and संविव्ययिथ ॥ The root व्येञ् is not changed to व्या (VI.1.46) in the Perfect. By (VII.2.63), the roots अद् and व्य would have optionally been सेट्, and ऋ never, therefore, the present _sutra_ makes the इट् augment compulsory. The इट् is repeated in the aphorism for the sake of clearness, the rule could have stood without it, for the _anuvritti_ of 'optionally' could not have run into it from the last _sutra_: for if it was an optional _sutra_, the enumeration of अद् and व्य was useless, as they were already provided for by (VII.2.63). Therefore, this _sutra_ makes an invariable rule.
