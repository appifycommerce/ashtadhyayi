sutra: वस्वेकाजाद्घसाम्
vRtti: कृतद्विर्वचनानामेकाचां धातूनाम् आकारान्तानां घसेश्च वसाविडागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The Participial affix वस् (वस्) gets the augment इट् only then when the reduplicated root before it consists of one syllable, or when it comes after a root ending in long आ, and after घस् ॥"

Thus आदिवान्, ओशिवान्, पेचिवान्, शेकिवान् ॥ In the first two of these, the reduplicate stems आद् and आश् become of one syllable by the coalescence of अ अद् and अअश् ॥ In पेच् and शेक् the reduplicate is elided and the vowel अ changed to ए, and thus the reduplicate has become of one syllable. Of roots ending in आ we have, ययिवान्, तस्थिवान्, of घस्-जक्षिवान् ॥ This वस् would have taken the augment by the general rule of इट् increment, the present _sutra_ makes a _niyama_, so that the roots which are not monosyllabic in their reduplicate form are _anit_: as बिभिद्वान्, चिच्छिद्वान्, बभूवान्, शिश्रिवान् ॥ The _niyama_ is made with regard to the roots which would have taken इट् generally, as not being governed by the prohibition in (VII. 2. 13). The roots ending in long आ may consist of more than one syllable in their reduplicate form, as याया + वस्, hence their separate enumeration: as a matter of fact, however, these reduplicates also become monosyllabic ultimately by losing their आ ॥ The root दरिद्रा is not governed by this rule, for its Perfect will be formed periphrastically by (III. 1. 35) _Vartika_, because it consists of more than one syllable: as दरिद्रांचकार ॥ And when आम् is not added, there also दरिद्रा loses its final आ before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes by the _vartika_ under (VI. 4. 114). So the आ being elided before the adding of any affix, this becomes a root which no longer ends in आ, and so the cause of adding इट् under this _sutra_ no longer exists, and so no इट् is added. Thus we have ददरिद्वान्, for before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes दरिद्रा loses its आ ((VI. 4. 114) _Vartika_), and this elision being considered as _siddha_, ((VI. 4. 114) _Vartika_), no occasion remains for the augment इट् ॥ The घस् becomes जक्ष् in its reduplicate form (a stem of one syllable), but had it not been separately mentioned, then by (VI. 4. 100), the penultimate अ of घस् would have been elided first, before reduplication, because (VI. 4. 100), is subsequent in order to the rule ordaining reduplication. ((VI. 1. 14) &c). The अ being elided, we should have घ्स् only, which not having any vowel, could not be reduplicated. By its separate enumeration here, the augment इट् being ordained by a subsequent rule (VII. 2. 67), prevents even the rule of elision (VI. 4. 100). Having, therefore, first added इट्, we then elide the penultimate अ by (VI. 4. 98), this elided अ, however, becomes _sthanivat_ for the purposes of reduplication only by (I. 1. 52). Thus घस् + इवस् = घ्स् + इवस् (VI. 4. 98) = जक्ष् + इवस् = जक्षिवान् ॥
