sutra: तो हलादेर्लघोः
vRtti: हलादेरङ्गस्य लघोरकारस्य इडादौ सिचि परस्मैपदपरे परतो विभाषा वृद्धिर्न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Before an इट् - beginning s-Aorist of the _Parasmaipada_, the short अ of the root gets optionally _Vriddhi_, when the stem begins with a consonant, and the अ is prosodially short by being followed by a simple consonant.

Thus अकणीत् or अकाणीत्, अरणीत् or अराणीत् ॥ Why do we say 'of अ' ? Observe अदेवीत्, असेवीत् ॥ Besides this patent objection, there is another, not so manifest. If we had not taken अतः, the _sutra_ would have ordained _Vriddhi_ of every vowel (अचः (VII.2.3)), the _Vriddhi_ so ordained would be an अच् pertaining _Vriddhi_, and not an इक्-pertaining _Vriddhi_. Therefore ङित् affixes will not debar such _Vriddhi_, for the क्ङिति च (I.1.5), debars only इग्लक्षणा _Vriddhi_. Therefore कुटादि roots after which सिच् is ङित् (I.2.1), will get _Vriddhi_, which is not desired. Therefore we have only one form of न्यकुटीत्, न्यपुटीत् ॥

Why do we say 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe मा भवानशीत्, मा भवानटीत् from अश् and अट् ॥ Why do we say 'prosodially short'? Observe अतक्षीत्, अरक्षीत् ॥

But why does not _vriddhi_ take place in अचकासीत् from the root चकास् (Ad. 65) ? The _vriddhi_ does not take place on the maxim येन ना व्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्; for the rule applies to short अ only when a consonant intervenes between it and the affix, and not when both consonants and vowels intervene. In चकास् not only the consonants क् and स् intervene but also the vowel आ ॥ Hence there is no _vriddhi_. Moreover, the व्यवधान can be by one letter and not by more than one letter. Therefore, applying this maxim, the word लंघाः might have been omitted from the _sutra_ without any detriment. In that case, the form अतक्षीत् from the root तक्ष (_Bhu_ 685) will be explained by saying that rule (VII.2.7) does not apply to it, because two consonants intervene between अ and the affix. In this view of the case, the employment of the word लघोः in the _sutra_ is for the sake of distinctness only.

The word इट् is understood in this _sutra_, so that the rule applies to सेट् aorist. The rule therefore, does not apply to _Anit_ aorist, as अपाक्षीत् ॥

The form अपिपठिषीत् the aorist of the Desiderative root, is explained by saying that the long आ of _vriddhi_ is elided by (VI.4.64).
