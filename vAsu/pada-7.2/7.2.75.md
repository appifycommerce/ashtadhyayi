sutra: किरश्च पञ्चभ्यः
vRtti: किरादिभ्यः पञ्चभ्यः सनि इडागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The desiderative सन् takes इट् after कॄ and the four roots that follow it (_Tudadi_ 116-120)"

Thus चिकरिषति, जिगरिषति, दिदरिषते, दिधरिषते, पिप्रच्छिषति (I. 2. 8); (VI. I. 16). But सिसृक्षति not included in the five. The roots कॄ and गॄ would have optionally got इट् in the desiderative by (VII. 2. 41), which would have been optionally lengthened by (VII. 2. 38). But the इट् here being specifically ordained, does not get lengthened by (VII. 2. 38).
