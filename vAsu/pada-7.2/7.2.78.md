Thus ईडिध्वे, ईडिध्वम्, ईडिषे, ईडिष्व, जनिध्वे, जनिध्वम्, जनिषे, जनिष्व ॥ The root जनी (IV. 41) is taken here. The _Vikarana_ श्यन् has been elided in this case, as a Vedic irregularity, and so also there is not elision of the penultimate. In the secular literature the form is जायसे ॥ Here the य would prohibit इट् always. The जन् of the third class (III. 24) is also to be included, thus we have व्यतिजज्ञिषे, व्यतिजज्ञिष्व, व्यतिजज्ञिध्वम् in _karma_ _vyatihara_. Otherwise this root is _Parasmaipadi_. ध्व takes इट् after ईश् also, as ईशिध्वम् ॥

For this purpose, some read the _sutra_ as ईडजनोः स्ध्वे च; and स् stands here for से having its Locative dropped, and therefore the force of च in the _sutra_, according to this reading, is to draw in the _anuvritti_ of ईश from the previous _sutra_. Those who do not follow this reading, draw the whole of the last _sutra_ by force of च ॥ From these it may be asked, what is then the necessity of two _sutras_ ? Could not one _sutra_, like this, is, ईशीडजनां सेध्वयोः, have sufficed, as being shorter and more general ? To this there is no better valid answer than this विचित्रा हि सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनेः ॥

The form ध्वे being taken in the _sutra_, the rule will not apply to the ध्वम् of लङ् (Imperfect) : which will not take इट् ॥ But इट् will apply to the ध्वम् of the Imperative on the maxim एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वात् ॥
