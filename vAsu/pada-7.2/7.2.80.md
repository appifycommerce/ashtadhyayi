sutra: अतो येयः
vRtti: अकारान्तादङ्गादुत्तरस्य या इत्येतस्य सार्वधातुकस्य इय् इत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: ' After a Present stem ending in short अ, इय् is substituted for the _sarvadhatuka_ या (i.e. for the या of the augment यास् of the Potential).'

Thus पचेत्, पचेताम् and पचेयुः ॥ The य् of इय् is elided before affixes beginning with a consonant by (6.1.66). In the case of पचेयुः, the _pararupa_ of (6.1.96) is prevented. Why 'ending in a short अ'? Observe चिनुयात्, सुनुयात् ॥ Why 'short'? Observe यायात् ॥ Why _sarvadhatuka_? Observe चिकीर्ष्यात् ॥

The objector may say, the form चिकीर्ष्यात् will be so by the elision of अ under (6.4.48), and so there is no necessity of reading the _anuvritti_ of _sarvadhatuka_ in this _sutra_; for when अ is elided by अतोलोपः (6.4.48), in the case of _ardhadhatuka_ या the present rule cannot apply, as there is no base left which ends in अ ॥ To this we reply, this is not a good reason: for then in the case of पचेत् and यजेत् also, the rule अतो दीर्घो यञि (7.3.101) would apply, and the अ of पच would require to be lengthened. But that is not so. The fact is that the present _sutra_ debars rule (7.3.101). Therefore, as this इय् substitute debars the lengthening of (7.3.101), so it would debar the _lopa_ of (6.4.48). Therefore, if the _anuvritti_ of _sarvadhatuka_ be not read into this _sutra_, the इय् substitute would apply to _ardhadhatuka_ also, and the _lopa_-elision (6.4.48) would not help, as that would be superseded by this special rule. Therefore the _anuvritti_ of "_sarvadhatuka_" should be read into this _sutra_.

The above is stated on general grounds. But if the maxim मध्येऽपवादाः पूर्वान् विधीन् बाधन्ते नोत्तरान् (_Apavadas_ that are surrounded by the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the _apavada_ operations, supersede only those rules that precede, not those that follow them) be applied here, then the present _sutra_ would supersede only the preceding _sutra_ (6.4.48) and not the following _sutra_ (7.3.101) for which would not be superseded by the present _sutra_. In this view also, the _lopa_ being superseded at all events, the _anuvritti_ of '_Sarvadhatuka_' must be read into this _sutra_.

In the दीर्घ rule (7.3.101), the word '_sarvadhatuka_' is understood from (7.3.95). But according to some, the word तिङि of (7.3.88) is also understood there, so that they would lengthen the अ, before a _sarvadhatuka_ personal termination (तिङ्) only, and not before every _sarvadhatuka_ affix in general. According to this view, the present _sutra_ will debar only the _dirgha_ rule (7.3.101) and not the _lopa_ rule (6.4.48), on the maxim येन न प्राप्ति &c.

The word येयः in the _sutra_ is formed by या + इयः; and या is exhibited without any case-termination. Others say, the word is यः the sixth case of या formed on the analogy of विश्वपः by the elision of आ (6.4.140). Then यः + इयः = य + इयः (8.3.19) after this elision, there ordinarily would take place no _sandhi_; as this elision is considered _asiddha_ (8.2.1) for the purposes of (6.1.87). Contrary to this general rule, however, the _sandhi_ takes place here and we have येयः by (6.1.87). The अ in इयः is for the sake of pronunciation only. The real substitute is इय् ॥

Some read the _sutra_ as अतो यासियः ॥ So that the _sthani_ is यास् and not या, and यासियः is a genitive compound.
