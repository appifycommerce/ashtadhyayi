sutra: ईदासः
vRtti: आस उत्तरस्थानस्य ईकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: ई is substituted for the आ of आन, after आस् ॥

Thus आसीनो यजते ॥ (See (I.1.54)) by which the first letter of the second term after आसः which is exhibited in the Ablative is taken here). The आने which is in the 7th case in the last aphorism, should be taken in the 6th case in this.
