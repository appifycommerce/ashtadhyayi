sutra: युष्मदस्मदोरनादेशे
vRtti: युष्मदस्मदित्येतयोरनादेश विभक्तौ परत आकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: आ is substituted for the final of युष्मद् and अस्मद् before a case-ending, beginning with a consonant, when it is not a substitute.

---
The substitute case-endings are given in (VII.1.27) &c. Thus युष्माभिः, अस्माभिः, युष्मासु, अस्मासु ॥ Why do we say 'when it is not a substitute'? Observe युष्मत् and अस्मत् (VII. I. 31). The _anuvritti_of हलि need not be read into this _sutra_ from the preceding, for if that were so, the mention of अनादेशे would become redundant, because as a matter of fact no substitute case-ending begins with a consonant. However, reading this _sutra_ with (VII.2.89), we find that the scope of the present _sutra_ is before consonant beginning affixes.
