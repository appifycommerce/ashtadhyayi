sutra: उत्तरपदस्य
vRtti: उत्तरपदस्येत्ययमधिकारः, हनस्तोचिण्णलेरिति प्रागेतस्मात् । यदित ऊर्द्ध्वमनुक्रमिष्याम उत्तरपदस्येत्येवं तद्वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: Upto (VII. 3. 31) inclusive, the substitution of _Vriddhi_ will take place, for the first vowel of the second member in a compound.

This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_, and exerts governing influence upto (7.3.32) exclusive. The phrase "of the second member of the compound" should be supplied in all those _sutras_, to complete the sense. Thus in (7.3.11), the word उत्तरपदस्य should be supplied. As पूर्ववार्षिकं, अपरवार्षिकम्, पूर्वहैमनम्, अपरहैमनम् ॥

In those _sutras_, where the word denoting the first member is not exhibited in the Ablative case, as in (7.3.18), (7.3.19), (7.3.20), (7.3.21), the present _sutra_ is absolutely necessary for causing the _vriddhi_ of the second member. But in those _sutras_, where the first member is exhibited in the ablative case, as in (7.3.11) (अवयवात्), there this _sutra_ is only explanatory (and not absolutely necessary), and serves also the purpose of placing such _vriddhis_ under the category of '_uttarapada_-_vriddhi_'. This peculiar _vriddhi_ is liable to certain rules of accent, as in (6.2.105). Hence the importance of the present aphorism in those _sutras_ also, where the word is exhibited in the fifth case.
