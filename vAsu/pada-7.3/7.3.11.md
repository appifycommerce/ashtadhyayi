As पूर्ववार्षिकम्, पूर्वहैमनम्, अपरवार्षिकम्, अपरहैमनम् ॥ The composition with पूर्व and अपर &c takes place by (II.2.1). and then by (IV.3.18) there is ठक् after वर्ष, and अण् after हेमन्त with the elision of त by (IV.3.22). The _Tadanta_-_viddhi_, as a general rule, does not apply to compounds, so that a rule made applicable to a particular word, will not apply to a compound which ends with that word: but _tadanta_-_viddhi_ applies to a word denoting season when it takes an affix causing _Vriddhi_, and is preceded by a word denoting a portion. We draw this rule from the present _sutra_, for हैमनं being formed from हेमन्त by a _vriddhi_-causing affix (IV.3.22), the affix अण् will be applied to हेमन्त even when it is the second member of a compound, the first member of which denotes a part. (ऋतोर्वृद्धिमद्विधाववयवात् ( I.1.72) _Vartika_ _Mahabhashya_).

Why do we say 'denoting a portion'? Observe पूर्वासु वर्षासु भवं पौर्ववर्षिकम् with ठञ् (IV.3.11). The _tadanta_-_vidhi_ applies only when the first member denotes a portion.
