sutra: घेर्ङिति
vRtti: घ्यन्तस्याङ्गस्य ङिति प्रत्यये परतो गुणो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "For the इ and उ of the stems called घि (1. 4. 3) _Guna_ is substituted in Dative, Ablative and Genitive Singular."

As अग्नये, वायवे, आग्नेः, वायोः, (VI. I. 110). Why of घि stems? Observe सख्ये, पत्ये ॥ Why in the Singulars of the Dative, Ablative and Locative only? Observe अग्निः-भ्याम् ॥ The word case ending (सुपि) is understood here also, as the counter-examples are पट्वी, कुरुतः ॥

The word पट्वी is formed by adding ङीष् to पटु (IV. 1. 44). ङीष् is not a case-affix, though it is ङित् and is added to पटु which is घि ॥ कुरुतः is no proper example: for though तस् which is added to कुरु is ङित्, it is only so by _atidesa_ (सार्वधातुकमपित्), and moreover कुरु is not घि ॥
