sutra: आङो नाऽस्त्रियाम्
vRtti: घेरुत्तरस्याङो नाभावो भवति अस्त्रियाम् ॥
vRtti_eng: "ना is substituted for the ending आ of the Instrumental singular, after the _Ghi_ stems, when they are not Feminine."

As अग्निना, वायुना, पटुना ॥ Why do we not say आङो मा पुंसि 'मा is substituted for आ in the Masculine'? Answer: In order to form the neuter Instrumentals also, as त्रपुणा, जतुना ॥ Objection: These can be formed by the augment नुम् under rule (VII. 1. 73), and not by the ना of this _sutra_. Answer: But अमुना will not be so formed as अमुना ब्राह्मणकुले ॥ Because सु substituted for दस् of अदस् (VIII. 2. 80) is considered as _asiddha_ or non-existent (VIII. 2. 1) for the purposes of the application (VII. 1. 73), and as अमु cannot take नुम्, it will take ना by this rule. Why do we say "not in the Feminine?" Observe कृत्या, धेन्वा ॥
