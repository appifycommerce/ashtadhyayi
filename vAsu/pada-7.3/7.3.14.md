sutra: प्राचां ग्रामनगराणाम्
vRtti: प्राचां देशे ग्रामनगराणां दिश उत्तरेषामचामादेरचोवृद्धिर्भवति तद्धिते ञिति णिति किति च परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "After a word denoting direction, the first vowel of the name of a village or city in the land of the eastern people, gets the _Vriddhi_ before a _Taddhita_ affix having an indicatory ञ्, ण् or क् ॥"

Thus पूर्वैषुकामशमः, अपरैषुकामशमः, पूर्वकार्ष्णमृत्तिकः, अपरकार्ष्णमृत्तिकः (IV. 2. 107). These are village names. पूर्वपाटलिपुत्रकः, अपरपाटलिपुत्रकः, पूर्वकान्यकुब्जः, अपरकान्यकुब्जः ॥

The word प्राचां in this _sutra_, as well as in (VII. 3. 24), does not here mean 'the eastern grammarians', but 'the eastern countries', because of the context. पूर्वैषुकामशमः is this formed. पूर्वा च असौ इषुकामशमी = पूर्वेषुकामशमी ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 1. 50). Then the affix ञ is added to it, in the sense of ततो भवः by (IV. 2. 107). In पूर्वपाटलिपुत्रकः the affix वुञ् is added by (IV. 2. 123). Though _Pataliputra_ is the name of one city, _Purva_-_pataliputra_ means the Eastern portion of the city _Pataliputra_. 

That place is called '_grama_', where people reside, and a 'nagara' is also a '_grama_' in this sense. Therefore, the rules which good men observe with regard to '_grama_', are observed by them in '_nagara_' also. Thus the rule is अभक्ष्यो ग्रामकुक्कुटः, therefore, the नागर cock is also not eaten. So also ग्रामे नाध्ययम् is applied to _nagara_ also. In this grammar also, we see that '_grama_' includes '_nagara_' also, as in (IV. 2. 109), (IV. 2. 117), (VI. 2. 103). Therefore, where is the necessity of employing the word नगर separately in this aphorism? The two words are separately used, in order to indicate the separate nature and relation of the two kinds of words. The full word पूर्वेषुकामशमी is the name of a '_grama_', and not the portion इषुकामशमी ॥ But in पूर्वपाटलिपुत्र, the word पाटलिपुत्र itself is the name of the '_nagara_'. In the present _sutra_, there is the _adhikara_ of अङ्गस्य and of उत्तरपदस्य ॥ We apply these separately to these two classes of words: namely ग्रामवाचिनाम् अङ्गानाम् and नगरवाचिनाम् उत्तरपदानाम् ॥ This we could not have done without employing these words in the _sutra_. Therefore, in the case of '_grama_' word, the _vriddhi_ takes place in that portion of it which follows a direction denoting word (ग्रामवाचिनामङ्गानामवयवस्य दिकशब्दादुत्तरस्य वृद्धिर्भवति). While a _nagara_ word itself gets _vriddhi_ when it is preceded by a direction denoting word (दिशः उत्तरेषां नगराणाम्) ॥ In पूर्वैषुकामशमः, the _vriddhi_ of इषुकामशमी takes place first, and then the combination by _sandhi_. See on this point (VII. 3. 22).
