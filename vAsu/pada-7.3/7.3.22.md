sutra: नेन्द्रस्य परस्य
vRtti: इन्द्रशब्दस्य परस्य यदुक्तं तन्न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: But the _Vriddhi_ of the first vowel of _Indra_, when it stands as the second member of a _Dvanda_ compound, does not take place before a _Taddhita_ affix having an indicatory ञ्, ण्, or क् ॥

As सौमेन्द्रः, आग्नेन्द्रः ॥ Why "when it stands as the subsequent member"? Observe ऐन्द्राग्न मेकादशकपालं चरुं निर्वपेत् ॥ There are two vowels in the word इन्द्र, and when a _Taddhita_ affix is added, then one of these i. e. the अ or the last vowel is elided by (VI.4.148), and the other (i. e. the इ, coalesces with the last vowel of the first term, as सोम + इन्द्र + अण् = सोम + इन्द्र् + अ = सोमे + न्द्र् + अ ॥ Now, no vowel is left of इन्द्र when it gets the form न्द्र्, so what is the necessity of the present prohibitory rule? This prohibition indicates the existence of the following maxim : बहिरङ्गमपि पूर्वोत्तरपदयोः पूर्वं कार्यं भवति, पश्चादेकादेशः or in other words पूर्वोत्तरनिमित्तकार्यात् पूर्वमन्तरङ्गोऽप्येकादेशो न ॥ "The substitution of one vowel for the final of the first and the initial of the second member of a compound does, even when it is _antaranga_, not take place previously to an operation which concerns the first or the second member of the compound". It is on this maxim that the forms पूर्वशुकामशम (VII.3.14) &c are constructed, otherwise उ being the first vowel of the second member (इ of इषु having merged in पूर्व), would have been _vriddhied_.
