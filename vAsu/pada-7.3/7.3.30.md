sutra: नञः शुचीश्वरक्षेत्रज्ञकुशलनिपुणानाम्
vRtti: नञ उत्तरेषां शुचि ईश्वर क्षेत्रज्ञ कुशल निपुण इत्येतेषामचामादेरचो वृद्धिर्भवति, पूर्वपदस्य वा भवति तद्धिते ञिति णिति किति वा परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: Before a _Taddhita_ affix having an indicatory ञ्, ण्, or क्, the _Vriddhi_ is always substituted for the first vowel of शुचि, ईश्वर, क्षेत्रज्ञ, कुशल and निपुण when preceded by the Negative particle, but this substitution is optional for the vowel of the Negative particle.

As अशौचम् or आशौचम्, अनैश्वर्यम् or आनैश्वर्यम्, अक्षैत्रज्ञ्यम् or आक्षैत्रज्ञ्यम्, अकौशलम् or आकौशलम्, अनैपुणम् or आनैपुणम् ॥ Some say the optional _vriddhi_ of the negative particle is an _aprapta_-_vibhasha_, no other rule would have caused its _vriddhi_ had this rule not existed. They argue that by (V.1.121), all affixes denoting भाव are prohibited after a _Tatpurusha_ compound with the negative particle; therefore, the words शुचि &c, should be first developed by the addition of भाव-affixes, and then they should be compounded with the negative particle, which may be optionally _vriddhied_ by this rule, which would apply to it, though it is not an _anga_, because the rule teaches _vriddhi_. Others controvert this opinion, and hold that other affixes causing _vriddhi_ than भाव-affixes, also come after negative-_Tatpurusha_ compounds, such as affixes denoting descendant &c: and भाव-affixes are added to _Bahuvrihi_ negative compounds also, therefore, the force of the _anuvritti_ of अङ्ग, which is understood up to the end of the Seventh _Adhyaya_ (VI.1.1), and a fortiori in this _sutra_ also, should not be set aside as the above interpretation would do. Moreover the full _Taddhita_ compounds अक्षेत्रज्ञ and अनीश्वर are read in the list of _Brahmanadi_ words (V.1.124), and as such they take the भाव affix ष्यञ् which would have always caused the _vriddhi_ of अ, but for this _sutra_ which makes it optional. Therefore it is a _prapta_-_vibhasha_.
