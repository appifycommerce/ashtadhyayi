sutra: नोदात्तोपदेशस्य मान्तस्यानाचमेः
vRtti: उदात्तोपदेशस्य मान्तस्याङ्गस्याचमिवर्जितस्य चिणि कृति च ञ्णिति यदुक्तं तन्न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Vriddhi_ is not substituted before the Aorist चिण् or a _krit_-affix with indicatory ञ् or ण् for the vowel of that root which ends in म and is acutely accented in its original enunciation (__Dhatupatha__), but not so in चम् after आ ॥

The _vriddhi_ of the penultimate अ takes place before णित्  and ञित् affixes (VII.2.116), that _vriddhi_ does not take place in the case of _udatta_ roots ending in म् ॥ Thus अशमि, अतमि, and अदमि in चिण् ॥ Compare (VI.4.92), (VI.4.93). Similarly with कृत् affixes, as शमकः, तमकः, दमकः, शमः, तमः, दमः ॥ Why do we say 'acutely accented'? Observe यामकः, रामकः ॥ How do you explain उद्यम and उपरम? These are irregular forms exhibited by _Panini_ himself in the _Dhatupatha_ अडउद्यमे (_Bhuadi_ 380), यम उपरमे (_Bhuadi_ 1033) Why do we use "in the original enunciation or _upadesa_"? So that the rule may apply to शमी, दमी, तमी, but not to याममः, रामकः ॥ Here to the root शम्, तम् and दम् is added the affix घिनुण् (III.2.141). The words शमिन्꣡ &c. get the affix-accent, namely acute इ꣡; and thus the root-vowel becomes _anudatta_. Though the root now becomes _anudatta_, yet because in its _upadesa_ it was _udatta_, the present _sutra_ will apply and prevent _vriddhi_. The roots यम्, रम् are _anudatta_ in _upadesa_, but in यामकः, रामकः they become _udatta_ by लित् accent. This accent is a secondary accent and not the 'original' accent; and hence the present rule does not apply and there is _vriddhi_. Why do we say ending in म्? Observe चारकः पाठकः ॥ Why with the exception of आचम्? Observe आचामकः ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the roots आ-चम्, कम् and वम्, as वामः, कामः and आचामः ॥ In the case of कस्, the affix घञ् is added in that alternative, when the root does not take the affix णिङ् (III.1.31). It thus gets _vriddhi_.

The word आमः is formed from the _Churadi_ अम्, which with the affix णिच् gets _Vriddhi_, because णिच् is not a _krit_-affix, and is not therefore governed by this rule. If you say "let there be _vriddhi_ of णिच्, but this _vriddhi_ will be shortened by (VI.4.92) because it is a मित् root", we reply "this root is not मित्" ॥ The मित् roots are those enumerated in _Bhuadi_ class, subdivision घटादिः (800). No doubt, there it is said that the roots ending in अम् are मित् (in अमन्ताश्च). But a root is regarded मित् only with regard to the Causative णिच् affix, and not with regard to that णिच् of the _Churadi_ class where the sense of the causative is not involved in it. Therefore this root is not मित् (VI.4.93).

The phrases सूर्यविश्रामा भूमिः and others like it are incorrect. Why do we say 'चिण् and _krit_ only'? Observe शशाम, ददाम, चचाम ॥
