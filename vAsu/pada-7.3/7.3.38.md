sutra: वो विधूनने जुक्
vRtti: वा इत्येतस्य विधूननेर्थे वर्तमानस्य जुगागमो भवति णौ परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: वा gets the augment जुक् (ज्) before the affix णि when the Causative has the sense of 'shaking'.

---
As पक्षेणोपवाजयति ॥ But आ वापयति केशान् when the sense is not that of shaking. This form could have been obtained from the root वज् 'to move", (_Bhuadi_ 271) with the affix णि in the ordinary way without any augment. The special augment ज् to वा indicates that this root will not take युक्, which it would have otherwise done by the last _sutra_. The root वा belongs to _Bhuadi_ 969(ओवै शोषणे) ॥
