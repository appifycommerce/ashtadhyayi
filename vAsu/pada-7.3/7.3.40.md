sutra: भियो हेतुभये षुक्
vRtti: भी इत्येतस्य हेतुभयेऽर्थे षुगागमो भवति णौ परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The augment षुक् is added to the root भी before the affix णि, when fear is caused immediately owing to the agent of the Causative.

As मुण्डो भीषयते, जटिलो भीषयते ॥ See (I.3.68). Herealso भी with long ई being employed in the _sutra_, indicates that षुक् is added then only, when the root has the form भी, but when it assumes the form भा by (VI. I. 56), the proper augment पुक् will come: as मुण्डो भापयते ॥ Why do we say 'when the agent of the causative is himself the direct cause of fear'? Observe कुञ्चिकयैनं भाययति, for here कुञ्चिका causes fear and not the agent of the verb. The ई is _vriddhied_ and आय substituted.
