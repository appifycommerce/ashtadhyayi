sutra: आदाचार्याणाम्
vRtti: अभाषितपुंस्कादातः स्थाने योऽकारस्तस्याचार्याणामाकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "According to the opinion of other Teachers, आ is substituted for the अ which arose from the shortening of the feminine आ of a word which has no corresponding masculine form."

As खट्वाका, अखट्वाका or परमखट्वाका ॥

Note: The "Teachers" referred to here are either those other than the Northern Grammarians, or it may refer to the Teacher of _Panini_, the plural being for the sake of respect. Thus there are three forms अखट्वका, अखट्विका, and अखट्वाका ॥
