sutra: स्वागतादीनां च
vRtti: स्वागत इत्येवमादीनां यदुक्तं तन्न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The prohibition and augment taught in (VII. 3. 3) does not apply also to स्वागत &c."

As स्वागतिकः, (= स्वागतमिति आह) स्वाध्वरिकः, (= स्वधरेण चरति) स्वाङ्गिः, व्याङ्गिः, व्याडिः (sons of _Svanga_, _Vyanga_ and _Vyada_). व्यावहारिकः and स्वापतेयः (= स्वपतौ साधुः) ॥ The word व्यवहार does not mean reciprocity of action, for then it would have been governed by the last _sutra_. स्वपत being a compound with स्व, would have been governed by (VII. 3. 4) as it is included in the _Dvaradi_ list, hence its specific mention here. The following is the list of _svagatadi_ words.

1 स्वागत, 2 स्वध्वर, 3 स्वङ्ग, 4 व्यङ्ग, 5 व्यड, 6 व्यवहार, 7 स्वपति ॥
