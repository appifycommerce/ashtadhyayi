As दधद्रत्ना दाशुषे _Rig_ I.35.8. सामो ददद् गन्धर्वाय _Rig_ X. 85. 41. But also यदग्निरग्नये ददात् ॥ The form ददात्, however, may also be deduced even when the final of  दा is elided, for then by the आट् augment (III.4.94) we get this form. The word वा is therefore employed in the _sutra_ only for the sake of distinctness, for the _sutra_ without वा would have also given the above forms, as we have shown. Or the वा is used to remove the doubt which one may entertain to this effect " ददात् is the form which may be deduced by the general rule, since लोप is taught, this form will be excluded altogether and will never appear".

The form दधत् is thus evolved. We add तिप् to the root धा; then the इ of ति is elided (III.4.97). दाशुषे = यजमानाय रत्नानि दद्यात् ॥ Others say, the दधत् is the form of the root with the शतृ affix. ददत् is from the root दाञ् ॥

Some say that वा is _jnapaka_ and indicates the existence of the following maxim :- अनित्यमागमशासनम् "the rule about augments is _anitya_". So that the augment आट् being _anitya_, we could not have got the form ददात् ॥ Hence the employment of the word वा ॥
