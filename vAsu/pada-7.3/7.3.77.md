sutra: इषुगमियमां छः
vRtti: शितीति वर्तते ॥ इषु गमि यम इत्येतेषां शिति प्रत्यये परतश्छकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: छ् is substituted for the final of इष्, गम् and यम् before a Present-character (शित्) ॥

As इच्छति, गच्छति, यच्छति ॥ The इष् with the indicatory उ is taken here, (_Tudadi_ 50), and not इष् of _Divadi_ (19) class or of _Kryadi_ class (53). There we have इष्यति and इष्णाति respectively. Those who do not read the _sutra_ as इषु &c, but as इषगमि &c, read the _anuvritti_ of the word अचि from (7.3.72) into this _sutra_; so that the शित् is qualified by the word अच्, i.e. a शित् affix which is merely a vowel, and has no consonant in it; (and not a शित् affix which begins with a vowel). Therefore though शानच् is a शित् affix beginning with a vowel, yet as it contains a consonant, the छ substitution does not take place, as इषाणः (3.1.83) The reading of the text according to _Patanjali_ and _Katyayana_ is इषगमियमां छ, and hence the necessity of the above explanation. The reading इषु, though convenient, is not _arsha_.
