sutra: ज्ञाजनोर्जा
vRtti: ज्ञा जन इत्येतयोर्जादेशो भवति शिति परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: Before a शित् affix, जा is substituted for ज्ञा and जन् ॥

---
As जानाति and जायते ॥ The जन् here belongs to _Divadi_ class, meaning 'to be produced', and not जन् of the _Juhotyadi_ class. Why जा (long) and not ज, for this ज would assume the form जा by (VII.3.101)? This long आ of जा indicates the existence of the maxim given above in (VII.3.78); and had ज been the substitute, (VII.3.101), could not have lengthened it.
