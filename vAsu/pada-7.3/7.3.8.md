sutra: श्वादेरिञि
vRtti: श्वादेरङ्गस्य इञि परतो यदुक्तं तन्न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A compound beginning with श्वन्, and followed by the _Taddhita_ affix इञ्, is not governed by the prohibition, nor takes the augment, taught in (VII. 3. 4).

Thus the descendant of श्वभस्त्र is श्वाभस्त्रिः, so also श्वादंष्ट्रिः ॥ The word श्वन् is included in the list of _Dvaradi_ words (VII.3.4)., the present _sutra_ implies that the rule (VII.3.4) applies not only to those words, but to compounds beginning with those words.

Vart:- This rule applies when any _Taddhita_ affix beginning with इ follows; as श्वगणेन चरति =  श्वागणिकः, श्वायूथिकः (IV.4.11).

The prohibition applies, when other _Taddhita_ affixes follow such a word ending with इञ् (an affix beginning with इ) : as from श्वाभस्त्रि we have श्वाभस्त्रम् (श्वाभस्त्रेरिदं) ॥
