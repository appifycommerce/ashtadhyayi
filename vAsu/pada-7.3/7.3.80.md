sutra: प्वादीनां ह्रस्वः
vRtti: पू इत्येवमादीनां ह्रस्वो भवति शिति परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "A short is substituted for पू &c, before a शित् affix."

The _Pvadi_ roots form a subdivision of the _Kryadi_ class, beginning with पूञ् पवने (2) and ending with प्ली गतौ (32). The ल्वादि roots (VIII. 2. 44) are a portion of प्वादि (numbers 13 to 32). Others hold that upto the end of the _Kryadi_ class are _Pvadi_. Thus पुनाति, लुणाति, स्तृणाति ॥ Those who hold that _Pvadi_ roots are upto the end of the Class, explain the non-shortening of जानाति (for ज्ञा would also then become _Pvadi_), by saying that the express text of (VII. 3. 79), substituting long जा prevents the shortening. They say had ज्ञा been also shortened, then merely ज substitute would have been enough and not जा; and this ज would have been lengthened in the case of जन् by (VII. 3. 101), to form जायते ॥
