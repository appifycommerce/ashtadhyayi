As अजुहवुः, अबिभयुः, अबिभरुः, अजागरुः ॥ This Personal ending is ङित् according to (1.2.4), and would not have caused _guna_ (1.1.5), but for this _sutra_. The ending जुस (III. 4. I08) comes in the लिङ् also. There, however, it does not cause _guna_. As चिन्युः, सुनुयुः ॥ Here there are two ङित् affixes, the augment यासुट्, and the _sarvadhatuka_ जुस्; and the यासुट् prevents _guna_. The इक् is read into the _sutra_ from (1.1.3).
