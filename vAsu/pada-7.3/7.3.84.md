vRtti_eng: The _Guna_ is substituted for the final इक् vowel of a stem before the affixes called _sarvadhatuka_ and _ardhudhatuka_ (III. 4. 113) &c).

As तरति, नयति, भवति, कर्तृ, चेतृ, स्तोतृ ॥ Why _sarvadhatuka_ and _ardhadhatuka_ affixes only? Observe अग्नित्वम् अग्निकाम्यति ॥ For had the _sutra_ been सङि then the rule would have applied to affixes like सन् काम्यच &c which go to form Denominative verbs. सङ् includes all affixes beginning with सन् and ending with महिङ् ॥ If the _sutra_ had been प्रत्यये, then the rule would have applied to the affixes like त्वम् &c. To exclude these cases, the two words _sarvadhatuka_ and _ardhadhatuka_ are used. For exceptions See (I.1.4), (I.1.5), (I.1.6).
