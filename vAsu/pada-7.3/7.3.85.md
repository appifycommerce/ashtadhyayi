sutra: जाग्रोऽविचिण्णल्ङित्सु
vRtti: जागृ इत्येतस्याङ्गस्य गुणो भवति अविचिण्णल्ङित्सु परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Guna_ is substituted for the ॠ of the stem जागृ, except before the affix वि, before the Aorist-character चिण्, before the Personal ending, णल् of the Perfect, and before an affix with an indicatory ङ् ॥

As जागरयति, with णिच्, जागरकः (with ण्वुल्) साधुजागरी, जागरं जागरम् (with णमुल्) जागरो वर्तते (with घञ्), जागरितः (with क्त), जागरितवान् (with क्तवतु) ॥ This is an exception to the _Vriddhi_ rule of (VII.2.115), and to the prohibition in (I.1.5). When this _guna_ is substituted, there does not take effect that rule, which causes _Vriddhi_ of the penultimate short अ of जागर; (अत उपधायाः (VII.2.116)). Had that been the case, then the _guna_ substitution would become simply useless, and the prohibition with regard to चिण् and णल् superfluous. Why do we say not before वि, चिण् and णल् and ङित्? Observe जागविः (with the affix विन् _Unadi_) अजागारि with चिण् which causes _Vriddhi_, and अजागार with णल्, and जागृतः and जागृथः with a ङित् (I.2.4) affix. Some hold that the इ in वि is for the sake of pronunciation only, and the prohibition applies to all affixes beginning with a व, such as कसु, as जजागृवान्, here there is no _guna_. In अजागरुः with जुस् the _guna_ takes place by virtue of (VII.3.83): for though it is a ङित् affix also, the prohibition ङितसु of this _sutra_ does not affect it. Similarly अहं जजागर with णल् the optional _guna_ (VII.1.91) is also not prohibited by the णल् of this _sutra_. In fact the phrase अविचिण् णल् ङितसु is a _Paryudasa_ prohibition : for had it been a _prasayya_-_pratishedha_, then the _guna_ before जुस् and the Ist Person णल् would also have been prohibited. In short this _sutra_ positively ordains _guna_ of जागृ before every affix, other than वि, चिण्, णल् and ङित्, and if by any other rule these latter would cause _guna_, that _guna_ is not prohibited. That is the result of _Paryudasa_ negation.

But if the _sutra_ be construed as a _Prasayyapratishedha_, then we shall apply the maxim अनन्तरस्य विधिर्वा भवति प्रतिषेधो वा ॥ The prohibition is therefore stated with regard to जाग्र in connection with the affixes वि, चिण्, णल् and ङित् ॥ But the _guna_ ordained by (VII.3.84), (VII.3.83) is not prohibited.
