sutra: पुगन्तलघूपधस्य च
vRtti: पुगन्तस्याङ्गस्य लघूपधस्य च सार्वधातुकार्द्धधातुकयोर्गुणो भवति ॥ _Karika_:- संयोगे गुरुसंज्ञायां गुणो भेत्तुर्न सिध्यति । विध्यपेक्षं लघोश्चासौ कथं कुण्डिर्न दुष्यति ॥ धातोर्हिनुम कथं रञ्जे, स्यदिश्रथ्योर्निपातनात् । अनङ्लोपशिदीर्घत्वे विध्यपेक्षे न सिध्यतः ॥ अभ्यस्तस्य यदाहाचि लङर्थं तत्कृतं भवेत् । क्नुसनो यत्कृतं कित्त्वं ज्ञापकं स्याल्लघोर्गुणे ॥
vRtti_eng: _Guna_ is substituted before a _sarvadhatuka_ and an _ardhadhatuka_ affix, for the इक् vowels of the Causative stems which take the augment प् (VII. 3. 36), and for the short penultimate vowel of a root which ends in a single consonant.

_Karika_:-

संयोगे गुरुसंज्ञायां गुणो भेत्तुर्न सिध्यति ।
विध्यपेक्षं लघोश्चासौ कथं कुण्डिर्न दुष्यति ॥
धातोर्हिनुम कथं रञ्जे, स्यदिश्रथ्योर्निपातनात् ।
अनङ्लोपशिदीर्घत्वे विध्यपेक्षे न सिध्यतः ॥
अभ्यस्तस्य यदाहाचि लङर्थं तत्कृतं भवेत् ।
क्नुसनो यत्कृतं कित्त्वं ज्ञापकं स्याल्लघोर्गुणे ॥

As व्लेपयति, ह्रेपयति, क्रोपयति, भेदनम्, छेदनम्, भेत्ता, छेत्ता ॥ Of course the vowel should be _laghu_ or light, before the addition of the affix; the heaviness caused by the addition of the affix, will not prevent. Thus भिद् + तृ, though द् + तृ = त्तृ  causes the इ to become heavy, that will not prevent _guna_: for विध्यपेक्षं लघुग्रहणम् ॥ Objection : If this be so, why the forms कुण्डितृ, हुण्डितृ are not incorrect, for in them also the vowel is _laghu_ (the roots are कुड् and हुड्), and the augment म् is added afterwards by a _Vidhi_ rule? Answer: The augment म् is added to the root, and becomes _upadesivat_. (See (VII.1.58)). Objection: If so, how do you cause _Vriddhi_ in रञ्ज्, as in रागः with घञ्; as रञ्ज् + घञ् = रज् + घञ् (the ञ् being dropped by (VI.4.27)), for it is after the elision of ञ्, that the of रज् becomes penultimate and can admit of _Vriddhi_ by (VII.2.116)? Answer: The exceptional forms स्यदः from स्यन्द् + घञ्, and श्रथः from श्रन्थ + घञ्, taught in (Vl. 4. 28); (VI.4.29) teach by implication that roots of this form take _Vriddhi_ as a general rule. Objection: If the विध्यपेक्ष maxim is not of universal application: though by (VI.4.134), the अ of अन् &c. is elided in _bha_ stems, like राजन् thus राज्ञा; yet the अ shoud not be elided if you be consistent, in आनङ् augment added by (VII.1.75) to दधि, अस्थि &c. In fact, you could not get the forms दध्ना सक्थ्ना &c. Moreover though there can be the lengthening of the penultimate in सामन् = सामानि (before शि affix Nominative Plural), yet not in the case of कुण्डानि from कुण्ड for here न् is added by another rule (VII.1.72). If you say, the maxim is not of universal application, then there can be no _guna_ of इ in भिद् to form भेत्तृ ॥ Answer: The _guna_ takes place in forms like भेत्तृ &c, because the prohibition of the following rule (VII.3.87), with regard to the affixes beginning with a vowel, proves by implication that before affixes beginning with a consonant, as तृ, the _guna_ also takes place. Objection: The prohibition in the case of vowel beginning affixes is for the sake of लङ्, to form अनेनेक् ॥ This is derived from निजिर् (_Juhotyadi_ 11), in the Imperfect, as अ + निज् + शप्श्लु + तिप् then reduplication (VI. I. 10), then _guna_ of the reduplicate, (VII.4.75), then तिप् which had become त in the Imperfect, is elided by (VI.1.68). Thus अनिज् + श्लु + त् = अ + निनिज् + त् (VI.1.10) = अ नेनिज् + त् (VII.4.75) = अ नेनिज् (VI.1.98) = अननक्. The elided त् produces its effect, the _guna_ by (VII.3.86). This is why अच् is taken in _sutra_ (VII.3.87), namely अजादि affixes do not cause _guna_, the हलादि affixes like त् cause _guna_. You cannot therefore say that अचि in (VII.3.87) is a _jnapaka_. Answer: The _sutra_ त्रसिगृधिधृषिक्षिपेः क्नुः (III.2.140) teaches the addition of नु to त्रस् &c, as गृध्नुः; if this नु had not tended to cause the _guna_ of the penultimate vowels of these roots, what was the necessity of making this affix a कित्? Similarly (I.2.10) teaches that सन् (Desiderative) is कित् after roots ending in consonants. These rules show that words like भत &c get _guna_, and the final consonant of the root plus the initial consonant of the affix, does not make the root vowel heavy. Objection: The कित् of सन् is for the sake of the elision of the nasal, in धिप्सति, धाप्सति (VI.4.24). Answer: Let it be so: still the कित् of क्नु is enough for us.

The "_upadha_ short" must be the vowels of the इक् _pratyahara_. Therefore in भिनत्ति, the penultimate is short अ (of श्नम्) and it does not take _guna_. In fact, the word penultimate qualifies the word इक् understood. Others explain it by saying that पुगन्त is to be analysed by पुकि अन्त "in the vicinity of प्" ॥ The word अन्त means समीप, and means the इक् vowel in the proximity of पुक् ॥ The word लघूपधा should be analysed as लघ्वी उपधा and is a _Karmadharaya_ compound, and means "a short or light penultimate". The word पुगन्तलघूपध is a _Samahara_ _Dvandva_.
