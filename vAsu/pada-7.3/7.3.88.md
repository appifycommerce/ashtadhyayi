sutra: भूसुवोस्तिङि
vRtti: भू सू इत्येतयोस्तिङि सार्वधातुके गुणो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "भू and सू get no _guna_ before an immediately following Personal ending which is _Sarvadhatuka_."

As अभूत्, अभूः, अभुवम्; सुवै, सुवावहै, सुवामहै ॥ The सू refers to the _Adadi_ root (21) in which the Present character is dropped, and does not refer to _Divadi_ (24) or _Tudadi_ (115) roots, because there the Present character श्यन् and श intervene between the Personal endings (तिङ्) and the root: and moreover the affixes श्यन् and श are ङित् (I. 2. 4) and would not cause _guna_. Why do we say before तिङ्? Observe भवति where the _guna_ takes place before शप् ॥ Why before a _sarvadhatuka_ affix? Observe व्यति भविषीष्ठ, where the Benedictive is not a _Sarvadhatuka_ (III. 4. 116), and the augment is of course considered as a portion of the personal ending. Why the _guna_ is not prohibited in बोभवीति when the Intensive यङ् is dropped, and the Personal ending is added directly to the root. Because the form बोभूतु in (VII. 4. 65) indicates by implication that _guna_ takes place in यङलुक् except in बोभूतु ॥

But of सू we have सोषुवीति where _guna_ has been prohibited in the Intensive, because there is no _jnapaka_ with regard to it.

The forms सुवै &c are the 1st Person Imperative of सू ॥
