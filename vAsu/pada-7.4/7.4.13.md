As ज्ञका, (VII.3.47) कुमारिका, किशोरिका, ब्रह्मबन्धुका ॥ Why आ, ई and ऊ only? Observe गोका, नौका ॥ The words राका, धाका are irregular being formed by _Unadi_ diversity, with the affix क added to रा and धा (_Unadi_ Ill. 40). By the following _sutra_, the rule does not apply to the affix कप्; it therefore implies that कन् is governed by this rule, though it has the _anubandha_ न् ॥ _Katyayana_ would confine this rule to the _Taddhita_ क, and not the _krit_ क of the _Unadi_, as राका, धाका; but _Unadi_ words are not derivatives (उणादयोऽव्युत्पन्नानि प्रातिपदिकानि), and hence no necessity of reading _Taddhita_ into the _sutra_.
