sutra: न कपि
vRtti: कपि प्रत्यये परतोऽणो ह्रस्वो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: But before the _samasanta_ affix कप् coming after _Bahuvrihi_ compounds, the अण् vowels are not shortened.

As बहुकुमारीकः, बहुवृषलीकः, बहुवधूकः, बहुलक्ष्मीकः ॥ The shortening ordained by (1.2.48) even does not operate when कप् follows.
For had there been upasarjana shortening (1.2.48), the present _sutra_ would be useless. Therefore, the very existence of this _sutra_ debars every sort of shortening. Objection: The present _sutra_ would not be useless, for it will find scope where there is no shortening of the _upasarjana_ by (1.2.48): namely before non-feminine affixes, as बहुयवागूकः; but there should be shortening in feminine affixes.  Answer: The shortening of (1.2.48) will not take place before कप् affix. Because the कप् affix will first be added to the second member in the sense of the compound, and then the word so ending in कप् will be compounded with the first member. So there is no _pratipadika_ left which ends in a feminine affix, and therefore (1.2.48), does not apply, because the _pratipadika_ now left is one ending in the affix कप् and not in a feminine affix.
