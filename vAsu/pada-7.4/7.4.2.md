sutra: नाग्लोपिशास्वृदिताम्
vRtti: अग्लोपिनामङ्गानां शासेर्ऋदितां च णौ चङ्युपधाया ह्रस्वो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The shortening of the penultimate of the stem, before the causative affix, in the reduplicated-Aorist, does not take place, when it is a (Denominative) stem, which has lost a simple (end vowel of the Nominal-stem), before the Causative sign and also not, when it is the verb शास्, or a root which has an indicatory ऋ ॥

The word अग्लोपिन् means literally a stem, in which a simple vowel (अक् _pratyahara_) or a portion containing an अक् vowel has been dropped. As the final vowels of Denominative stems are so elided before the Causative sign णि, the _sutra_ has been translated accordingly. Thus अममालत् = मालामाख्यत्; अममातरत् = मातरमाख्यत्, अत्यरराजत् = राजानमतिक्रान्तवान्, अन्वलुलामत् = लोमान्यनुमृष्टवान् ॥ Where a simple अक् vowel alone is elided, as in the case of माला, there the elided आ being _sthanivat_, would prevent the shortening, the आ of मा not being then considered penultimate. So that अग्लोपिन् could be spared from the _sutra_, since the _sthanivad_-_bhava_ would prevent shortening. But where an अक् vowel plus a consonant is dropped, as in राजन् and लोमन्, there the _sthanivad_-_bhava_ does not apply (I. I. 57), hence the necessity of employing the term अग्लोपिन् in the _sutra_. Similarly अशशासत् with शास्; and अबबाधत् from बाधृ, अययाचत् from याचृ, and अडुढौकत् from ढौकृ ॥ See (III. I. 21) and (III 1. 25).
