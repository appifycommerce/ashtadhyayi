sutra: शीङः सार्वधातुके गुणः
vRtti: शीङोऽङ्गस्य सार्वधातुके परतो गुणो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: For the vowel of शी, there is substituted _guna_, when a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix follows.

As शेते, शयाते, शेरते, but शिश्ये before the _ardhadhatuka_ affix (III.4.115). Though these _sarvadhatuka_ affixes were ङित् (I.2.4) and would not have caused _guna_ (l. 4. 5), they do so by virtue of the present _sutra_. The word शीङ् is read in the _sutra_ with the _anubandha_ ङ्, in order to indicate that the rule does not apply to यङ् लुक् as शेशीतः, शेश्यति ॥
