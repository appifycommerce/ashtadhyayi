sutra: अकृत्सार्वधातुकयोर्दीर्घः
vRtti: अकृद्यकारे असार्वधातुकयकारे च क्ङिति परतोजन्तस्याङ्गस्य दीर्घो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A long is substituted for the final vowel of the stem, before an affix beginning with a य् having an indicatory क् or ङ्, when it is not either a _Krit_ or a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix.

Thus भृशायते, सुखायते, and दुःखायते with the Denominative affix क्यङ् according to (III.1.12) and (III.1.18). चीयते and स्तूयते with the Passive यक्, चेचीयते and तोष्टूयते with the Intensive यङ्, and चीयात् and स्तूयात् in the Benedictive (See (III.4.116). But प्रकृत्य and प्रहृत्य where the affix ल्यप् is _krit_, and had the vowel been lengthened by this subsequent rule, the antecedent तुक् augment would have been debarred (VI.1.71). And चिनुयात् and सुनुयात् where the Personal endings of the Potential are _sarvadhatuka_. The phrase क्ङिति is understood in this _sutra_, so there is no lengthening before non-_kit_ and non-_nit_ affixes, as, उरुया, धृष्णुया, formed by या under (VII.1.39).
