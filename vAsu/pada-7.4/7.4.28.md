sutra: रिङ् शयलिङ्क्षु
vRtti: ऋकारान्तस्याङ्गस्य श यक् इत्येतयोर्लिङि च यकारादौ असार्वधातुके परतो रिङित्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "For the final short ऋ of a root, there is substituted रि, before the Present-character अ (श), before the Passive-character य, and before the augment यास् in the Benedictive."

The word लिङि in the aphorism is qualified by the phrase यकारादौ सार्वधातुके ॥ A _Lin_ affix which begins with a य and is not a _Sarvadhatuka_, is necessarily the augment यास् of the Benedictive. Thus श-आ द्रियते and आ घ्रियते (the व् comes by (VI. 4. 77)). यक्-क्रियते, ह्रियते ॥ लिङ्-क्रियात् and ह्रियात् ॥ This short रि debars the long  री of the last. The word non-_Sarvadhatuka_ being understood, the rule does not apply to the Potential, as बिभृयात् ॥ The यि (VII. 4. 22) is understood here also, therefore when the Benedictive affix does not begin with य्, the rule does not apply, as कृषीष्ट, हृषीष्ट ॥
