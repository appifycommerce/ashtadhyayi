sutra: गुणोर्त्तिसंयोगाद्योः
vRtti: ऋतो यकि लिङि इति वर्तते ॥ श इत्यत्रासंभवान्नानुवर्त्तते । गुणा भवत्यर्त्तेः संयोगादीनामृकारान्तानां यकि परतो, लिङि च यकारादावसार्वधातुके ॥
vRtti_eng: _Guna_ is substituted for the final ऋ in the root ऋ (अर्त्ति), and in those roots ending in ऋ, in which the vowel is preceded by a conjunct consonant, when the Passive character  or the Benedictive augment यास् follows.

The words ऋतः, यकि and लिङि are understood here. Not so the word श as its _anuvritti_ is impossible. Thus अर्यते, अर्यात्, स्मर्यते and स्मर्यात् ॥ This is an exception to (1.1.5). In सं स्क्रियते and संस्क्रियात् (6.1.135), there is no _Guna_, either because in स्कृ the augment स् is considered as _Bahiranga_ and therefore _asiddha_, or because it is considered as no part of (or non-attached to) कृ, and therefore स् कृ is not a root beginning with a conjunct consonant. See however (7.4.10), where in forming संचस्करतुः, स्कृ is considered as a root beginning with a conjunct consonant. See also _Mahabhashya_ on (6.1.135). The यि (7.4.22) is understood here also; the Benedictive affix must begin with य, therefore not here स्वृषीष्ट, ध्वृषीष्ट ॥ The word non-_sarvadhatuka_ is also understood here, the rule does not apply to the Potential, as इयृयात्, there is _slu_ substitution of _sap_, reduplication, then there is इ substitution in the reduplicate by (7.4.77), then इयङ् by (6.4.78).
