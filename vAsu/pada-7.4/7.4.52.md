sutra: ह एति
vRtti: तासस्त्योः सकारस्य हकारादेशो भवति एति परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: For the स् of तास् and अस् there is substituted ह् before the personal-ending ए ॥

---
As कर्त्ताहे, and व्यति हे from अस् ॥ See (VI.4.111). The ह substitution does not take place before the Personal ending एश् (III.4.8), as एधामासे ॥ The reason of this is that the ए referred to in this _sutra_, is that ए which can come after तास्; and that very ए should also come after अस् ॥ The ए that can come after तास् is the Ist Person singular ए; and not this ए of the Perfect 3rd Person singular. Others say, this even _sarvadhatuka_, and therefore not here सुप्तोऽहं त्वां प्रेक्षामासे ॥
