Thus आप्-ईप्सति, ज्ञपि-ज्ञीप्सति, ऋध्-ईर्त्सति (I. 1. 51). The reduplication is dropped by (VII. 4. 58). In the Causative stem ज्ञपि there are two vowels, the इ (णि) is dropped by _purva_-_vipratishedha_ (the prior debarring the subsequent) according to (VI. 4. 51), and ई (substituted for अ according to the present _sutra_. The word सन् is to be read into the _sutra_, otherwise प्रापस्यति ॥ The सन् must begin with स् i.e should not take the इट् augment, as in जिज्ञपयिषति, अर्हिधिषति ॥ The roots ज्ञपि and ऋध् are optionally सेट् in the Desiderative by (VII. 2. 49).
