sutra: मुचोऽकर्मकस्य गुणो वा
vRtti: मुचोऽकर्म्मकस्य गुणो वा भवति सनि सकारादौ परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: When मुच् has an Intransitive signification, _Guna_ is optionally substituted for its vowel before the _anit_ सन् of the Desiderative.

---
By (1.2.10), after a root ending in a consonant, the सन् is like कित् and does not cause _Guna_. The present _sutra_ ordains it optionally. As मोक्षते or मुमुक्षते वत्सः स्वयमेव ॥ In the Transitive there is one form only, as मुमुक्षति वत्सं देवदत्तः ॥ मुच् becomes Intransitive when it has a Reflexive significance, or when it expresses a mere action. The reduplication is elided by (7.4.58).
