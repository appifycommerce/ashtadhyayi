sutra: ह्रस्वः
vRtti: ह्रस्वो भवत्यभ्यासस्य ॥
vRtti_eng: A short is substituted for the long vowel of this reduplicate.

As डुढौकिषते, तुत्रौकिषते, डुढौके, तुत्रौके, अडुढौकत्, अतुत्रौकत् ॥

Vart:- The shortening takes place before affixes other than अच् (III.1.134) Before अच्, the roots चर्, चल्, पत् and वद् are reduplicated, and the augment अक् added to the reduplicate. See (VI.1.12) _Vartika_. This augment when added to the reduplicate, is not to be shortened by this rule: and because this is not to be shortened, also indicates that the consonants of the reduplicate other than the first are also not dropped: as चराचरः, चलाचलः, पतापतः, वदावदः ॥
