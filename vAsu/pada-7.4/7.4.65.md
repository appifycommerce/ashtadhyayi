The word छन्दसि is drawn in to this _sutra_, by force of च ॥ The form दाधर्त्ति, is either from the Causative of the root धृङ् अवस्थाने or from धृञ्, in the श्लु or यङ् लुक्, there is lengthening of the _abhyasa_ and elision of णि ॥ (2) So also दर्धर्त्ति is the form in _slu_, with रुक् augment of the _abhyasa_. (3) दर्धर्षि if it be a form of यङ् लुक्, there is no irregularity. (4) बोभूतु is from भू in the Intensive (यङ् लुक्), Imperative, irregularly without _guna_. Question: There is no necessity of including this, because there would be no _guna_ regularly even under (VII. 3. 88)? Answer: The inclusion of बोभूतु is a _jnapaka_, indicating that in every other case, the _guna_ is not prohibited in the Intensive (यङ् लुक्), as बोभेति, बोभवीति (लट् with ईट् (VII. 3. 94)) (5) तेतिक्तं is from तिज् in the Intensive _yan_ _luk_, _atmanepada_ is irregular. Question: The यङ् is ङित् and therefore by _pratyaya_ _lakshana_ rule (I. 1. 62) read with (I. 3. 12), the यङ् लुक् will be _atmanepadi_, where is the necessity of reading this _nipatan_? Answer: The _atmanepada_ _nipatan_ is a _jnapaka_, that in the Intensive _yan_ _luk_ the _atmanepada_ affixes are not employed. (6) अलर्षि is from the root ॠ (इयर्ति), in Present, 2nd Person, the र् of _abhyasa_ is not elided, though required by (VII. 4. 60), and this र् is changed to ल irregularly. This form is found in the 3rd Person also, as अलर्त्ति दक्षः ॥ (7) आ पमीफणत् is from फण् with आ augment, and शतृ affix is added to यङ् लुक्, and in the reduplicate मी is added. (8) संसनिष्यदत् is from स्यन्द with the Preposition सम्, in the Intensive yan _luk_, with शतृ affix, नि being added in the _abhyasa_, the root स is changed to ष ॥ The Preposition सं is not absolutely necessary, with other Prepositions also we have this form, as आ तमिष्यदत् ॥ (9) करिक्रत् is from कृ (करोति), in the Intensive _yan_ _luk_, with शतृ, in the _abhyasa_ there is no palatal change (VII. 4. 62), and रि is added to the reduplicate. (10) कनिक्रदत् from क्रन्द् in the Aorist with अङ्, reduplication, there is no _chutva_ ( VII. 4. 62) of the reduplicate, and the augment नि is added. In the secular literature, the form is अक्रन्दीत् ॥ (11) भरिभ्रत् from भृ (बिभर्ति) in _yan_ _luk_ with शतृ, without इ of (VII. 4. 76), without _jastva_, and रि is added to the reduplicate. (12) दविध्वतः from ध्वृ (ध्वरते) in the _yan_ _luk_, _satr_, plural number Nominative. The रि is added to the reduplicate, the ऋ is elided, दविध्वतः रश्मयः सूर्यस्य ॥ (13) दविद्युतम् is from _dyut_, _yan_ _luk_ with _satr_, there is no vocalisation of the reduplicate, with अ change and वि augment, (14) तरित्रतः from तृ (तरति) with _slu_, _satr_, genitive singular: and रि added to _abhyasa_. (15) सरीसृपत् from सृप् with _slu_, _satr_, Accusative with री added to _abhyasa_. (16) वरीवृजत् from वृज् with _slu_, _satr_ and री augment. (17) मर्मृज from मृज् with लिट् (Perfect) णल्, म् added to _abhyasa_, and य added to the root, and there is no _vriddhi_, because there is no short penultimate now. In fact (VII. 2. 114) is to be qualified by the words लघूपध from (VII. 3. 86). (18) आ गनीगन्ति is from गम् with the Preposition आ, in the Perfect, with _slu_, there is no _chutva_ ( VII. 4. 62), and augment मी is added. वक्ष्यन्ती वेदा गनीगन्ति कर्णम् ॥

The word इति in the aphorism indicates that other forms, similar to these, are also to be included.
