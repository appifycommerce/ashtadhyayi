sutra: व्यथो लिटि
vRtti: व्यथेर्लिटि परतोभ्यासस्य संप्रसारणं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: There is vocalisation of the half-vowel of the reduplicate of व्यथ् in the Perfect.

As विव्यथे, विव्यथाते, विव्यथिरे ॥ This ordains the vocalisation of य, which otherwise would have been elided as being a non-initial consonant (7.4.60). The vocalisation of व् is prevented by (6.1.37). Why do we say in the Perfect? Observe वाव्यथ्यते ॥
