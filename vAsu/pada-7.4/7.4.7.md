sutra: उर्ऋत्
vRtti: णौ चङ्युपधाया ऋवर्णस्य स्थाने वा ऋकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "Short ऋ is optionally substituted for the penultimate ऋ and ॠ of a Causative stem, in the reduplicated Aorist."

This debars the इर् (VII. 3. 101), अर् (VII. 3. 86), and आर् (VII. 2. 114) substitutes. Thus अचिकीर्तत् (VII. I. 101) or अचिकिर्तत् from कॄत् (_Churadi_ III) : अववर्तत् (VII. 3. 86), or अवीवृतत्; अममार्जत् (VII. 2. 114) or अमीमृजत् ॥ Though the इर्, अर् and आर् substitutes are _antaranga_ operations, they are prohibited by the express text of this _sutra_. The short ऋ is substituted even for a long ॠ : the त् of ऋत् shows that, as in अचीकृतत् (VIII. 2. 77). In fact, this ऋ substitute does not take place after the operations of इर्, अर् and आर् substitutions have taken effect, but it is a form which suspends the operation of all those rules.
