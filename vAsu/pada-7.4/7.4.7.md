sutra: उर्ऋत्
vRtti: णौ चङ्युपधाया ऋवर्णस्य स्थाने वा ऋकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Short ऋ is optionally substituted for the penultimate ऋ and ॠ of a Causative stem, in the reduplicated Aorist.

This debars the इर् (7.3.101), अर् (7.3.86), and आर् (7.2.114) substitutes. Thus अचिकीर्तत् (7.1.101) or अचिकिर्तत् from कॄत् (_Churadi_ III) : अववर्तत् (7.3.86), or अवीवृतत्; अममार्जत् (7.2.114) or अमीमृजत् ॥ Though the इर्, अर् and आर् substitutes are _antaranga_ operations, they are prohibited by the express text of this _sutra_. The short ऋ is substituted even for a long ॠ : the त् of ऋत् shows that, as in अचीकृतत् (8.2.77). In fact, this ऋ substitute does not take place after the operations of इर्, अर् and आर् substitutions have taken effect, but it is a form which suspends the operation of all those rules.
