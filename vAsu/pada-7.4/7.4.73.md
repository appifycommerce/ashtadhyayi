sutra: भवतेरः
vRtti: भवतेरभ्यासस्याकारादेशो भवति लिटि परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "अ is substituted for the vowel of the reduplicate of भू in the Perfect."

As बभूव, बभूवतुः, बभूवुः, बभूवे ॥ Why do we say 'in the Perfect'? Observe बभूषति and बोभूयते ॥

The word भवतेः is shown in the _sutra_ in the Active Voice, therefore the rule will not apply to Passive and Reflexive forms; as अनुबुभूवे कम्बलो देवदत्तेन ॥ This opinion of _Kasika_, however, is not endorsed by later Grammarians.
