sutra: निजां त्रयाणां गुणः श्लौ
vRtti: निजादीनां त्रयाणामभ्यासस्य गुणो भवति श्लौ सति ॥
vRtti_eng: _Guna_ is substituted for the vowel of the reduplicate, in the Reduplicated Present form (श्लु) of निज्, विज् and विष् ॥

Thus नेनेक्ति, वेवेक्ति, वेवेष्टि ॥ The word त्रयाणां could have been spared in this _sutra_, as these three roots stand at the end of a subdivision, and निजां would have denoted these three without the word _trayanam_. The word is however used here for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_. Why do we say in the reduplicated Present form? Observe निनेज in the Perfect.
