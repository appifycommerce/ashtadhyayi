sutra: गुणो यङ्लुकोः
vRtti: यङि यङ्लुकि च इगन्तस्याभ्यासस्य गुणो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "_Guna_ is substituted for the इ and उ (with their long) of a reduplicate, when the Intensive character of यङ् follows and also when it is elided."

Thus चेचीयते, लोलूयते with यङ्, and जोहवीति with यङ् लुक् ॥ The ईट् is added in the latter by (VII. 3. 94). So also चोक्रुशीति from क्रुश् (VII. 3. 94) and (VII. 3. 87).
