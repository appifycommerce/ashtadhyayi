sutra: दीर्घोकितः
vRtti: अकितोभ्यासस्य दीर्घो भवति यङि यङ्लुकि च परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "A long vowel is substituted for the अ of the reduplicate in the Intensive (with expressed or elided यङ्), when the reduplicate requires no augment having an indicatory क् ॥"
---
The reduplicate receives augments like मीक्, मुक् by the following _sutras_. Thus पापच्यते, and पापचीति, यायज्यते and यायजीति ॥ Why do we say "when it gets no augment"? Observe यंयम्यते, यंयमीति, रंरम्यते, रंरमीति ॥

Objection:- When the न् augment is added, the reduplicate will end in a consonant, and as it does not end in a vowel, there will be no occasion for lengthening; hence the employment of the term अकितः is useless.

Answer:- The employment of this term by the _Acharya_ indicates the existence of the following maxim : अभ्यासविकारेष्वपवादानोत्सर्गान् विधीन् बाधन्ते "so far as changes of a reduplicative syllable are concerned, rules which teach those changes do not supersede one another". What is the necessity of this indication (_jnapaka_)? Observe डोढौक्यते, here the rule of lengthening of this _sutra_, does not supersede, though it is subsequent, the rule of shortening in (VII. 4. 59); so the diphthong औ is shortened to उ, and it is then _gunated_ by (VII. 4. 82). Secondly observe अचीकरत्, here इ is substituted in the reduplicate by (VII. 4. 79) plus (VII. 4. 93), and then this is lengthened by (VII. 4. 94), the latter not superseding the former. Thirdly observe मीमांसते &c, where in मान् + सन् (III. I. 6), the reduplicate is lengthened, but that does not prevent the इ of (VII. 4. 79). Fourthly observe अजीगणन्, where the ई substitute (VII. 4. 97) does not supersede the _sutra_ (VII. 4. 60), by which the ण् of गण् is elided.
