sutra: ईच गणः
vRtti: गणेरभ्यासस्य ईकारादेशो भवति चङ्परे णौ परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "In the Reduplicated Aorist of the Causative, ई is substituted optionally for the vowel of the reduplicate in गण् ॥"

As अजीगणत् or अजगणत् ॥ गण is a root which ends in अ, and this अ being elided by (VI. 4. 48) before the Causative णि, the rule (VII. 4. 93), does not apply to it, because there is an _ak_-_lopa_ here, so in the other alternative, it has its natural अ ॥
