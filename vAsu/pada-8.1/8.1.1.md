sutra: सर्वस्य द्वे
vRtti: सर्वस्येति च द्वे इति चैतदधिकृतं वेदितव्यम् । इत उत्तरं यद्वक्ष्यामः प्राक् पदस्येत्यतः सर्वस्य द्वे भवत इत्येवं तद्वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: "From here upto (VIII. 1. 15) inclusive, is to be supplied always the phrase 'the whole word is repeated'."
---
This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_. Whatever will be taught hereafter upto पदस्य (VIII. 1. 16) exclusive, there the phrase सर्वस्य द्वे should be supplied to complete the sense. Thus (VIII. 1. 4) teaches "when the sense is that of 'always', and 'each'." Here the phrase 'the whole word is repeated' should be supplied to complete the sense. i. e. "The whole word is repeated when the sense is that of always and each". What is to be repeated? That which is most appropriate in sound and sense both. Thus one पचति becomes two, as पचति पचति 'he always cooks'. Similarly ग्रामो ग्रामो रमणीयः 'every village is beautiful'.

The _sutra_ '_sarvasya_ _dve_', should not be confounded as meaning 'the word-form _sarva_ is doubled'. For then rules likes (VI. 1. 99), and (VI. 1. 100) will find no scope. The word _sarva_ has several meanings: (1) the totality of things (द्रव्यः) as सर्वस्वं ददाति, (2) the totality of modes (प्रकारः) सर्वान्नीनोभिक्षुः = सर्वप्रकारमन्नं भक्षयति; (3) the totality of members (अवयवः), as सर्वः पटोदग्धः ॥ In the present _sutra_, the word _sarva_ has this last sense: namely all the members of a word are doubled, no portion is omitted. The force of the genitive case in _sarvasya_, is that of _sthana_, i. e. in the room of the whole of the words like परि &c there is doubling. So one meaning of the _sutra_ is, that in the room of the one word, two are substituted. In making such substitution, we must have regard to the rule of nearness.

Another meaning of the _sutra_ however is, that it does not teach substitution but repetition or employment, not _adesa_, but _prayoga_. That is to say, one word is employed twice. In this sense, of course, there is no room left for finding out the proper substitute. The very word-form, पचति &c, is employed twice, i. e. is repeated twice or pronounced twice.

The word _sarvasya_ is employed in the _sutra_ for the sake of distinctness only. Otherwise, one may double only the last letter of a word by the rule of अलोऽन्तस्य, though that rule is not, strictly speaking, applicable to such cases.

Objection:- The word पदस्य should be employed in the _sutra_, in order to prevent the application of the rule to _Samasa_ (compound), to _taddhitas_, and to _vakyas_ (sentences). Thus सप्तपर्णोऽष्टापदम् ॥ Here there is the sense of _vipsa_ with regard to seven leaves, and does not mean a tree having seven leaves. There ought to have been doubling; but it would not take place, if we take the word _padasya_ in the aphorism. Similarly द्विपदिकां ददाति, here also the sense is that of _vipsa_, and there ought to have been doubling, before the affixing of the _taddhita_ affix. So also in ग्रामे ग्रामे पानीयम् the sentence ग्रामे पानीयम् is not doubled, if we employ _padasya_. So the word _padasya_, should be employed in the _sutra_. Moreover, it would prevent our employing the word _padasya_ again in (VIII. 1. 16).

Answer:- We could not employ the word _padasya_ in this _sutra_, for then the rule would become very much restricted. Moreover in the above examples, there can be no doubling; for सप्तपर्णः means 'that whose every twig bears seven leaves पर्वणि पर्वणि सप्तपर्णानि अस्य : so that the sense of _vipsa_ is not here inherent in the word _sapta_ or _parna_. In the case of the _taddhita_ example, there would be no doubling, because the force of _vipsa_ is there denoted by the _taddhita_ affix itself, and so doubling is not necessary. Moreover, a sentence can never be doubled, because _vipsa_ can take place with regard to a word, and not a sentence. Therefore the word पदस्य should not be employed in the _sutra_.

On the contrary, if we employ the word _padasya_ in the _sutra_, it would give rise to the following anomalies. We could not have प्रपचति प्रपचति; for _upasarga_ being considered as a separate _pada_, only पचति would be doubled, and प्र would not. So also, we have two forms द्रोग्धा and द्रोढा ॥ Here तृच् is added to the root दुह्, and ह is optionally changed to घ by (VIII. 2. 77), and in the other alternative there is ढ ॥ As घ and ढ are both _asiddha_ (VIII. 2. 1), the doubling would take place without making this घ or ढ substitution. So that having first doubled the word (something as द्रोह्ता द्रोह्ता) then optional घ or ढ change will take place, and we shall get wrong forms, like द्रोग्धा द्रोढा, द्रोढा द्रोग्धा in doubling. While the correct forms are द्रोढा द्रोढा, or द्रोग्धा द्रोग्धा, and not the hybrid doubling as given above. Hence the necessity of the _vartika_ पूर्वत्रासिद्धीयमद्विर्वचने (See (VIII. 2. 3) last _vartika_).

Or the word सर्व may be considered to be formed by अच् affix of अर्श आद्यच्, meaning सर्वं कार्यं यस्मिन्नस्ति तदिदं सर्व, तस्य द्वे भवतः ॥ That is, all operations having been first performed, then the word is doubled; so that a word in its inchoate state is not doubled.
