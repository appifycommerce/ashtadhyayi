sutra: कर्म्मधारयवदुत्तरेषु
vRtti: इत उत्तरेषु द्विर्वचनेषु कर्म्मधारयवत्कार्यं भवतीत्येतद्वेदितव्यम् । कर्मधारयत्वे प्रयोजनं सुब्लोपपुंवद्भावान्तोदात्तत्वानि ॥
vRtti_eng: "In the following rules, the double-word is treated like a _Karmadharaya_ compound."
---
The reason for making it a _Karmadharaya_ is to elide the case-affix (II. 4. 71), to make the first member a masculine term even when the word refers to a feminine (VI. 3. 42), and to regulate the accent by (VI. 1. 223). Thus पटुपटुः, मृदुमृदुः where the first member has lost the case-affix. पटुपट्वी, मृदुमृद्वी where the first member is treated as a masculine, even when there is a क in the penultimate as कालककालिका (See (VI. 3. 37) and (VI. 3. 42); पटुपटुः꣡, पटुपट्वी꣡, the accent falls on the final, for the rule (VI. I. 223) was debarred by (VIII. I. 3), but the present rule re-instates (VI. I. 223). The word उत्तरेषु is for the sake of distinctness, the _sutra_ being an _adhikara_ one, would have applied to the subsequent aphorisms, without even the word _uttareshu_.
