sutra: पदस्य
vRtti: पदस्येत्ययमधिकारः प्रागपदान्ताधिकारात् । यदित ऊर्ध्वमनुक्रमिस्यामः पदस्येत्येव तद्वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: "Upto (VIII. 3. 54), inclusive, should be always supplied in every subsequent _sutra_, the phrase "of a word", or "to the whole of a word "."

This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_, and extends up to (VIII. 3. 55). Whatever we shall treat of here-after, should be understood to apply to a full '_pada_' or a completed word. Thus (VIII. 2. 23), (संयोगान्तस्य लोपः) teaches "there is elision of the final of what ends in a conjunct consonant". The word पदस्य must be supplied here to complete the sense : viz, of a word which ends in a conjunct consonant, the final is elided. Thus पचन्, यजन्, from पचन्त् and यजन्त् ॥

Why do we say 'of a _Pada_'? Observe पचन्तौ, यजन्तौ where the त् though _sanyoganta_ is not elided, because the stem is no longer called _pada_. The force of the Genitive in पदस्य must be construed according to the context, sometimes as _sthana_-_shashthi_ i.e. "in the room of the whole _pada_"; and sometimes as _avayava_-_shashthi_ i.e. "of a _pada_-of the portion of a _pada_ ".
