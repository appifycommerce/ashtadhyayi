sutra: अनुदात्तं सर्वमपादादौ
vRtti: अनुदात्तमिति च सर्वमिति च अपादादाविति च एतत्त्रयमधिकृतं वेदितव्यमापादपरिसमाप्ते, रित उत्तरं यद्वक्ष्यामः अनुदात्तं सर्वमपादादावित्येवं तद्वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: "Upto (VIII. 1. 74), inclusive is to be supplied the phrase 'The whole is unaccented, if it does not stand at the beginning of the foot of a verse'."
---
The three words _anudattam_ "unaccented ", _sarvam_ "the whole", and _apadadau_ "not in the beginning of a _Pada_ of a verse", should be understood to exert a governing influence over all the subsequent _sutras_ of this chapter, upto its end. Whatever we shall treat of hereafter, must be understood to be wholly unaccented, provided that, it does not stand as the first word of a verse or stanza. Thus (VIII. 1. 19), says "of a Vocative ". The whole of this _sutra_ should be read there to complete the sense, viz: "all the syllables of a Vocative are unaccented when a word precedes it, and it does not stand as the first word of a hemistich"; as पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ॥

Why do we say "when not at the beginning of a hemistich"? Observe यत्ते नियतं रजसं मृत्यो अनवधृष्ण्यम्, here मृत्यो though in the Vocative case, is not _anudatta_, as it stands at the beginning of a _Pada_.

Similarly (VIII. I. 21), teaches "वः and नः are the substitutes of युष्मद् अस्मद् in the plural". The present _sutra_ must be read there to complete the sense, viz, when not at the beginning of a verse. Thus ग्रामोवः स्वं, जनपदो नः स्वम् ॥ But at the beginning of a hemistich, we must have the forms युष्माकं and अस्माकं instead of वः and नः ॥ As,

रुद्रो विश्वेश्वरो देवो युष्माकं कुलदेवता ।
स एव नाथो भगवानस्माकं शत्रुमर्दनः ॥

The word पाद् in the _sutra_ refers both to the hemistiches of the sacred _Rik_ hymns, as well as to secular _slokas_.

Question: Why do we employ the word सर्वं in the _sutra_?

Answer:- The word _sarvam_ is used in the _sutra_, in order to indicate that a word, which has not acute accent on the first syllable, should also become _anudatta_. For the word पदात् (VIII. 1. 17) is in the ablative case, and shows that the operation taught in any _sutra_ governed by it, will be performed on the first syllable, according to the maxim आदेः परस्य ॥ Therefore, by rule (VIII. 1. 28), the word प꣡चति, which is acutely accented on the first syllable, (because शप् and तिप् are _anudatta_), will only lose its accent in देवदत्तः पचति; but not so the verb करोति which is acutely accented in the middle (by the _vikarana_ accent) in देवदत्तः करोति ॥ But by force of the word सर्वं, करोति also loses its accent.

Question: This cannot be the reason, for the author indicates by his prohibition in _Sutra_ (VIII. 1. 29), that a verb loses its accent, where ever that accent may be. For there is no verb when conjugated in लुट् which has acute on the first syllable.

Answer:- The word '_sarvam_' is used to prevent the operation of अलोऽन्त्यविधिः; for where the rule आदेः परस्य will not apply there the other will apply: so that, if "_sarvam_" was not used, the rule would apply to the finals, and not to cases where there were other than initials to be operated upon. Thus the rule (VIII. 1. 28) would apply to कुरुतः꣡ which is finally acute by (VI. 1. 186), in देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तौ कु॒॒रु॒॒तः॒॒, but not to देवदत्तः करोति ॥

Question: No; this cannot be the reason of employing the word '_sarvam_' in the _sutra_, for the author indicates that the rule is not confined to the finals, by the prohibition he makes in favor of लृट् in (VIII. 1. 51); for there is no verb, when conjugated in _Lrit_, which has acute on the final. All _Lrit_ is acute in the middle by (VI. 1. 186). So the अलोऽन्त्यस्य rule does not apply.

Answer:- The word '_sarvam_:' is used for this reason. Had '_sarvam_', not been used, then in those cases where there was no other rule to apply, like (VIII. 1. 19), there only the word would become _anudatta_. But in cases where another rule also operated, there this _anudatta_ rule would not apply, for then there would be two different sentences. For a thing which is already in existence can be made the subject of a rule ordering certain operations to be performed on it; but not so a thing which will come in existence in future time. Thus the words वां and नौ are ordained as substitutes of _yushmad_ and _asmad_ by one sentence (VIII. 1. 20); while another sentence ordains their _anudatta_-hood. So here there is separation of sentences (_vakya_-_bheda_): which is not desireable; for a _vakya_ _bheda_ should be avoided, if possible. But by employing the word '_sarvam_:', this _vakya_-_bheda_ is made tolerable.

Another reason for employing this word is that the substitutes वां and नौ should come in the room of the whole declined forms of _yushmad_ and _asmad_, with their case-affixes. Had not this word (_sarvam_) been used, then वां and नौ would have replaced only '_yushmad_' and '_asmad_'. Objection:- Will not the _anuvritti_ of the word '_padasya_', cause the whole declined word to be replaced by वां and नौ, not only the crude-forms _yushmad_ and _asmad_? And there cannot be a full word unless it takes case-affixes; so the whole of _yushmad_ and _asmad_ with their case-affixes will be replaced. Where is the necessity of using the word '_sarvam_'? Answer:- This objection will apply to those cases where a _Pada_ is a word ending in a case-affix. But the word पद is a technical term also, and applies to crude forms before certain case-affixes. Thus a nominal stem (not a full word) is also called _Pada_ by (I. 4. 17), before non-_sarvanamasthana_ case-affixes. Therefore _yushmad_ and _asmad_ will be _pada_ before those affixes. Thus before the affix of Dative Dual, they will be called _Pada_; and had सर्वं not been used, then only "_yushmad_" and "_asmad_" will be replaced and not their case-affixes. Thus ग्रामो वां दीयते, जनपदो नौ दीयते ॥ Here वां and नौ would require after them the case-affix भ्यां otherwise.
