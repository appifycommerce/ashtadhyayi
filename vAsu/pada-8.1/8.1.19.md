sutra: आमन्त्रितस्य च
vRtti: आमन्त्रितस्य पदस्य पदात्परस्यापादादौ वर्त्तमानस्य सर्वस्यानुदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: All the syllables of a Vocative are unaccented when a word precedes it, and it does not stand at the beginning of a hemistich.

---
Thus पचसि दे॒व॒द॒त्त॒, पचसि य॒ज्ञ॒द॒त्त॒ ॥ The Vocative is acutely accented on the first by (VI.1.198), the present makes it all unaccented.

Vart:- The rules relating to _nighata_ (by which all syllables of a word become unaccented, such as the present, and (VIII.1.28) &c) and to the substitutes of _yushmad_ and _asmad_ apply then only, when the preceding word which would cause the _nighata_ or the substitution, is part of the same sentence with the latter word. Therefore not here:- अयं दण्डो, हरानेन ॥ "This is the staff. Carry by means of it." Here हर does not lose its accent by (VIII. I. 28), though preceded by the Noun _danda_, because these are parts of two different sentences. ओदनं पच, तव भविष्यति । ओदनं पच, मम भविष्यति ॥ "Cook the food, it will be for thee. Cook the food, it will be for me." That is the rice cooked by thee, will do both for thyself and myself. Here the ते and मे substitutions have not taken place (VIII. I. 22) for _yushmad_ and _asmad_, for the same reason.

Another example is, भवतीह विष्णुमित्रो, देवदत्तागच्छ "_Vishnumitra_ is here, Come back _Devadatta_." Here _Devadatta_, though in the Vocative case, does not lose its accent. Nor can you say that समर्थः पदविधिः will make this _vartika_ redundant. In all the above examples, the different sentences are connected with each other in sense. Thus in the last example, _Devadatta_ was searching for _Vishnumitra_, when some one says to him, 'Here is _Vishnumitra_ come back _Devadatta_." Thus the two sentences are _samartha_, yet there is no _nighata_. But the rule will apply here:- इह देवदत्त ! माता ते कथयति । नद्यास्तिष्ठति॑ (VIII.1.28) कूलं । शालीनां ते ओदनं दास्यामि ॥ In the last examples the Vocatives, the verbs and the substitutes of _yushmad_ and _asmad_ are not in syntactical construction with the words that immediately precede them, and yet the _nighata_ rule &c does apply: inspite of the general maxim समर्थः पदविधिः (II.1.1), for rules relating to completed words apply to such words only which are in construction.

In the last example, the construction is इह स्थिता माता ते देवदत्त, and not इह देवदत्त. Thus इह is in syntactical construction with स्थिता and not देवदत्त, yet it causes _nighata_ of _Devadatta_. Similarly in नद्यास्तिष्ठति कूलं, the word नद्याः is not in construction with तिष्ठति, but with कूलं, i.e. नद्याः कूलं तिष्ठति; yet it causes the _nighata_ of तिष्ठति ॥ Similarly शालीनां is not in construction with ते, but with ओदनं, i.e. शालीनां ओदनं ते दास्यामि ॥ Yet it causes ते substitution of _yushmad_. Though the preceding words are not _samartha_ with regard to the words that follow them, they cause the changes, because the words are in the same sentence.
