sutra: अनुदात्तं च
vRtti: अनुदात्तं च तद्भवति यदाम्रेडितसंज्ञम् ॥
vRtti_eng: That which is called _amredita_ is gravely accented.

Thus भुङ्क्ते भु॒॒ङ्क्ते॒; पशून् प॒शू॒न् ॥

That is, all the vowels of the _amredita_ become _anudatta_ or accentless. In the above examples, the root भूञ् becomes _atmanepadi_ by (I.3.66): the Personal endings are _anudatta_ by (VI.1.186); the _vikarana_ शनम् gets the acute by (III.1.3); the अ꣡ of this न꣡ is elided by (VI.4.111), and thus भुङ्क्ते꣡ becomes finally acute by _udatta_-_nivrtti_-_svara_ (VI.1.161). The _amredita_ _bhunkte_ becomes wholly _anudatta_. The word पशु is formed by the affix कु and is finally acute.
