sutra: नित्यवीप्सयोः
vRtti: नित्ये चार्थे वीप्सायां च यद्वर्त्तते तस्य द्वे भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The whole word is repeated when the sense is of 'always' and 'each'.

What words express 'always'? The finite verbs, and the Indeclinable words, formed by _krit_ affixes. What 'always' is meant here? The word '_nitya_' here means 'again and again', and this idea of 'repetition' is the quality of an action. That action which the agent does principally, without cessation, is called "_nitya_". So that _nitya_ refers to an action (See (III.4.22)). Thus पचति पचति 'he cooks continually'. जल्पति जल्पति 'he talks incessantly'. भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति or भोजं भोजं व्रजति 'each one, when he has eaten goes away.' See (III.4.22). लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं लुनाति (See III.4.2). The affixes _ktva_ and _namul_ formed words and the Imperative mood express the idea of 'again and again', only when they are repeated. While the words formed with the affix यङ् (Intensive) express this idea by the inherent force of the affix, without repetition. Thus पुनः पुनः पचति = पापच्यते ॥ And when this intensive action is continually done, then this word also should be repeated; as पापच्यते पापच्यते ॥ In the above, examples have been given of _nitya_, as illustrated by finite verbs like पचति, Indeclinable _krit_ words like भुक्त्वा, and like भोजं ॥ Now for वीप्सा ॥ In what words the वीप्सा is found ? It is found in nouns (सुप् formed words). As finite verbs (तिङ्) express _nitya_, so inflected nouns (सुप्) express _vipsa_ or a distributive sense. What is meant by the word _vipsa_? It is the wish of the agent to pervade (_vyaptum_ _ichchha_) an object through and through with a certain quality or action. That is, when many objects are wished to be pervaded by the speaker, with a particular attribute or action simultaneously, it is _vipsa_. Thus ग्रामो ग्रामो रमणीयः 'every village is beautiful'. So also जनपदो जनपदो रमणीयः पुरुषः पुरुषो निधनमुपैति ॥

When a finite verb is repeated owing to the idea of _nityata_; and we also wish to add to such a verb the affix denoting comparative or superlative degree, such affix must be added after the word has been repeated, as पचति पचतितराम् ॥ But in the case of a noun, which is repeated owing to _vipsa_, the whole superlative or comparative word should be repeated, as आढ्यतरमाढ्यतरमानय ॥
