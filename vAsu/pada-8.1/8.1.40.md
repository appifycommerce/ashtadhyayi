Thus अहो देवदत्तः प꣡चति शोभनं, अहो विष्णुमित्रः करो꣡ति चारु ॥ The separation of this अहो from तु &c, of the last _sutra_, indicates that the next rule applies to अहो only. Had अहो been joined with तु &c, then Rule (VIII.1.41), would have applied to तु &c, which is not desired. Hence the making of it a separate _sutra_.
