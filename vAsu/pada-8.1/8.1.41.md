sutra: शेषे विभाषा
vRtti: अहो इत्यनेन युक्तं तिङन्तं शेषे विभाषा नानुदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A finite verb retains its accent optionally when in connection with अहो in the remaining cases (i.e. where it does not mean praise).

What is the शेष alluded to here? The शेष means here senses other than पूजा or 'praise'. Thus कटमहो करिष्यसि or कटमहो क॒रि॒ष्य॒सि॒ ॥ This is a speech uttered in anger or envy and not in praise (असूया वचनं) ॥ So also मम गेहमेष्यसि ॥

The word शेष is employed in the _sutra_ simply for the sake of distinctness; for _sutra_ 40 applies to cases of _puja_, while this _sutra_ will give option in cases other than _puja_.
