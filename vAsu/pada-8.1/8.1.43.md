sutra: नन्वित्यनुज्ञैषणायाम्
vRtti: ननु इत्यनेन युक्तं तिङन्तं नानुदात्तं भवति अनुज्ञैषणायां विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: "A finite verb retains its accent in connection with ननु, when with this Particle, permission is asked."

The word एषणा means 'asking, praying'. The word अनुज्ञा means 'permission'. The compound अनुज्ञैषणा means 'asking of permission'. Thus ननु करो꣡मि भोः, "may I do it, sir"; ननु ग꣡च्छामि भोः 'can I go sir'. The sense is 'give me permission to do or to go'.

Why do we say when 'asking for permission'? Observe अकार्षी कटं देवदत्त ? ननु क॒रो॒मि॒ भोः '_Devadatta_ hast thou made the mat? Well, I am making it'. Here ननु has the force of an answering particle, and not used in asking permission and hence the verb loses its accent.
