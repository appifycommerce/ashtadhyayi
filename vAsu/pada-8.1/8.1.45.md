sutra: लोपे विभाषा
vRtti: किमो लोपे क्रियाप्रश्ने तिङन्तमनुपसर्गमप्रतिषिद्धं विभाषा नानुदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When however किम् is not added in asking such a question, the finite verb may optionally retain its accent.

---
When किम् is elided in asking a question relating to an action, the finite verb which is not preceded by a Preposition or a Negative Particle, optionally does not become _anudatta_. When is there the elision of this किम् because no rule of _Panini_ has taught it? When the sense is that of an interrogation, but the word किम् is not used. In short, the word '_lopa_' here does not mean the Grammatical substitute, but merely non-use. As देवदत्तः प꣡चति (or प॒च॒ति॒) आहोस्वित् प꣡ठति (or प॒ठ॒ति॒) Here the sentence is interrogative, even without the employment of किम् ॥ The option of this _sutra_ is a _Prapta_-_vibhasha_, as it is connected with the sense of किम् ॥ The counter-examples are the same as in the last aphorism, but without किम् ॥
