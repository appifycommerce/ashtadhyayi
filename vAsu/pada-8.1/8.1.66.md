sutra: यद्वृत्तान्नित्यम्
vRtti: प्रथमा छन्दसीति निवृत्तं, निघातप्रतिषेध इत्येव ॥
vRtti_eng: "In connection with यद् in all its forms, the verb retains its accent always."
---
The _anuvritti_ of प्रथमा and छन्दसि ceases. The prohibition of _nighata_, which commenced with न लृट् (VIII. I. 29) is present here also. In what ever sentence the word यद् occurs, that is called यद्वृत्तं ॥ The word वृत्तं denotes here the form of यद् in all its declensions with case affixes. According to _Kasika_, उतर and उतम are not included, according to _Patanjali_ they should be included. See also the explanation of किंवृत्तं in (VIII. 1. 48).

Thus यो भुङ्क्ते꣡, यं भोज꣡यति, येन भुङ्क्ते꣡, यस्मै ददाति, यत् कामास्ते जुहुमः꣡ (_Rig_ _Veda_ X. 121. 10) यद्रयङ् वायुर्वा꣡ति  (_T_. _S_. V. 5. I. I.) यद् वायुः प꣡वते ॥ For the form यद्रयङ् see (VI. 3. 92). Though the _sutra_ is in the Ablative (यद्वृत्तात्) and therefore requires that the verb should immediately follow it, yet in यद्रयङ् वायु र्वाति, the intervention of वायुः does not prevent the operation of this rule, according to the opinion of _Patanjali_.

Vart:- Optionally when the sense is that of 'wheresoever' or 'whensoever'. The word याथाकाम्यं means यथेच्छं 'as one wishes', without regard of time or space. The _nighata_ is prohibited here also. As यत्र क्व चन यजते तद् देवयजन एव यजते ॥
