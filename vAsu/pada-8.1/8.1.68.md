sutra: सगतिरपि तिङ्
vRtti: सगतिरगतिरपि पूजनेभ्यः काष्ठादिभ्यः परं पूजितं तिङन्तमनुदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: (After such words denoting praise) the finite verb (which is praised) becomes _anudatta_, even along with the _Gati_, if any, that may precede it.

---
Whether a finite verb is compounded with a _gati_ or stands single, both the compound and the simple verb lose their accent, when it is qualified by the adverbs काष्ठं &c. Thus यत् काष्ठं प॒च॒ति॒, यत् काष्ठं प्र॒प॒च॒ति॒ ॥ By (VIII. I. 28), the finite verb would have lost its accent after the word काष्ठं, but this loss was prohibited by (VIII. I. 30) in connection with यत्; the present _sutra_ re-ordains the loss, by setting aside the prohibition of (VIII.1.30).

The word सगति 'along with its _Gati_', indicates that the _Gati_ even loses its accent. The word _Gati_ here is restricted to _Upasargas_. Therefore not here यत् काष्ठं शुक्ली करोति, यत् काष्ठं कृष्णी करोति ॥

The word तिङ् is used in the _sutra_ to indicate that the words qualified by काष्ठं &c in the preceding _sutra_, were non तिङ् words- i. e. were substantives. The rule of मलोपश्च of that _sutra_, therefore, does not apply here.
