Thus अभ्यु꣡द्धरति, स॒मुदा꣡मयति, अभि॒सं॒प॒र्या꣡ हरति ॥ Why do we say गतिः "a _Gati_ becomes &c"? Observe दे꣡वदत्तः प्रपचति ॥ Here देवदत्त is a _Pratipadika_ and does not lose its accent. Why do we say 'when followed by a _Gati_'? Observe आ꣡ मन्द्रैरिन्द्र हरिभि र्याहि मयूर रोमभिः ॥ Here आ is a _Gati_ to the verb याहि, the complete verb is आयाहि ॥ But as आ is not followed by a _Gati_, but by a _Pratipadika_ मन्द्र, it retains its accent. Had the word गतौ not been used in the _sutra_, this आ would have lost its accent, because the rule would have been too wide, without any restriction of what followed it.
