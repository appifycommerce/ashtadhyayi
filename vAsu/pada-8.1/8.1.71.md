sutra: तिङि चोदात्तवति
vRtti: गतिरिति वर्त्तते ॥ तिङन्ते उदात्तवति परतो गतिरनुदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A _Gati_ becomes _anudatta_, when followed by an accented finite verb.

The word गतिः is understood here. Thus यत् प्र प꣡चति, यत् प्र॒करो꣡ति ॥

Why have we used the word तिङि in the _sutra_ ? In order to restrict the scope of the word उदात्तवति; so that a _Gati_ would not become accentless before every _udatta_ word, but only before _udatta_ verbs. Thus आ does not become _anudatta_ before मन्द्रैः in आ꣡ मन्द्रै꣡ रिन्द्र हरिभि र्याहि ॥ If it be said that the word गति is a particular name which the Particles get before verb only, and therefore गति would always refer to its correlative term verb, and not to noun, like as the word father refers to its correlative term son and not nephew: and that, therefore, उदात्तवति must refer to the verb like याहि and not to a noun like मन्द्रैः; then also we say that the employment of the term तिङि is necessary, in order to indicate that the verb must be a finite verb, and not a verbal root. So that though a verbal root be _udatta_, yet if in its conjugated form (तिङन्त) it is not _udatta_, the गति will not lose its accent. Thus in यत् प्रकरोति, the root कृ is _anudatta_, but the तिङन्त form करोति is _udatta_, hence the rule will apply here: which would not have been the case had उदात्तवति not been qualified by तिङि ॥ For the maxim is यत्क्रियायुक्ताः प्रादयस् तेषां तं प्रति गत्युपसर्गसंज्ञे भवतः ॥  Therefore in a तिङन्त, the designation of गति is with regard to धातु or verbal root. Objection: If तिङि is used for this purpose, then the rule will not apply to an आम् ending forms, like प्र पचतितराम् and प्रपचतितमान्, for these are not तिङन्त; but as a matter of fact, we find that प्र loses its accent, in these forms also. How is this explained? Answer:- Here there are two views : some compound the _Gati_ प्र with the completed आमन्त form पचतितराम् ॥ According to them, this प्र would get the accent, on the rule that an Indeclinable first member retains its accent (VI.2.2); so that even if the word तिङ् was not used in the _sutra_, the form पचतितराम् being the second member of a compound, became _anudatta_; and so प्र being followed by an _anudatta_ never loses its accent. According to them, therefore, the _Gati_ never loses its accent in प्र꣡पचतितराम् &c. Others compound the word ending in तरप् (पचतितर) with the _Gati_, and having formed प्रपचतितर, then add the affix आम् ॥ According to this view, the आम् accent debars all other accents, on the maxim, 'the accent of the last prevails' (सतिशिष्ठः), and so प्र is _anudatta_, not by this rule, but by अनुदात्तसर्वे पदमेकवर्जं ॥ According to them the word is प्रपचतितराम्꣡ ॥ According to both of these views, this _sutra_ is not necessary for the purposes of प्रपचतिराम् &c. But there is a third view which makes this _sutra_ necessary even for this purpose. There is this maxim: गतिकारकोपपदानाम् कृद्भिः सह समासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः "It should be stated that _Gatis_, _Karakas_ and _Upapadas_ are compounded with bases that end with _Krit_-affixes, before a case-termination has been added to the latter". This maxim itself has been explained in two different ways, one saying that the compounding takes place with _krit_-formed words only before the addition of case-affixes; but with words formed by _Taddhita_ affixes, the compounding does not take place before a case affix has been added. The other view makes no such difference between _krit_-formed and non-_krit_ formed words. This latter view is not necessary for our purposes. According to the first view, the _Gati_ प्र can never be compounded with पचतितराम् as it is not a सुबन्त ॥ So both प्र and पचतितराम् having different accents, the present _sutra_ became necessary to cause the loss of accent of प्र ॥

Why have we used the word उदात्तवति? See प्र꣡ पचति, प्र꣡ करोति ॥ Here the verb loses, its accent by (VIII.1.28), hence the _Gati_ retains its accent.
