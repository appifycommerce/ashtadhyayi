sutra: विभाषितं विशेषवचने बहुवचनम्
vRtti: पूर्वेणाविद्यमानवत्वे प्रतिषिद्धे विकल्प उच्यते ॥ विशेषवचने समानाधिकरणे आमन्त्रितान्ते परतः पूर्वमामन्त्रितं बहुवचनान्तं विभाषितमविद्यमानवद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When the preceding Vocative is in the Plural number, it is optionally considered as non-existent, if the subsequent Vocative, in apposition with it, is a specific term.

This ordains option, where the last _sutra_ would have made the consideration of the first vocative as existent compulsory. Thus दे꣡वाः श꣡रण्याः or दे꣡वा श॒र॒ण्याः॒ ॥ ब्रा꣡ह्मणा वै꣡याकरणाः or ब्रा꣡ह्मणा वै॒या॒क॒र॒णाः॒ ॥

The _anuvritti_ of सामान्यवचनम् is understood here; the second vocative, therefore, must be a विशेषवचन, as being the correlative of the former: where is then the necessity of employing the word विशेषवचने in the _sutra_? This word is used in the aphorism for the sake of precision only.

Why do we say 'in the plural number'? Observe मा꣡णवक ज॒टि॒ल॒क॒ ॥ No option is allowed here, and the preceding vocative is always considered as existent and so rule (8.1.73) applies.

The _sutras_ (8.1.73) and (8.1.74) as enunciated by _Panini_ are:- 73. नामन्त्रिते समानाधिकरणे; 74. सामान्यवचनं विभाषितं विशेषवचने (i. e. (8.1.73). The preceding Vocative is not considered as non-existent, if the subsequent word is a Vocative in apposition with it. 74. Optionally so, if the preceding vocative is a general term and the subsequent vocative is a particular term). _Patanjali_ made the amendment by adding सामान्यवचने to 73 also, and the author of _Kasika_ has added बहुवचनम् to 74 from the commentary of _Patanjali_ and has omitted सामान्यवचनं from it: though he reads its _anuvritti_.
