sutra: अनुदात्तं प्रश्नान्ताभिपूजितयोः
vRtti: अनुदात्तः प्लुतो भवति प्रश्नान्ते अभिपूजिते च ॥
vRtti_eng: "The end-vowel at the end of a question or of a praise is _pluta_, but unaccented."

That which is employed at the end of an interrogative sentence is called प्रश्नान्तः ॥ According to some, this rule does not ordain _pluta_, but only ordains the _anudatta_-ness of those syllables which become _pluta_ by the previous rules (VIII. 2. 84) &c. The meaning of the _sutra_ then is:- That _pluta_ which comes at the end of an Interrogative sentence or a sentence denoting admiration, is _anudatta_.

Thus अगमा꣡३ : पूर्वा꣡३म् ग्रामा꣡३न् अग्निभूता॒॒३इ or अगम॑३: पूर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् पटा॒॒३उ (i.e. अगमः पूर्वान् ग्रामान् अग्निभूते or पटो) ॥ The words अग्निभूते, and पटो being finals in a question, become _anudatta_ as well as _pluta_. The other words अगमः &c become _svarita_ and _pluta_ by (VIII. 2. 105). See (VIII 2. 107).

As regards अभिपूजिते we have शोभनः खल्वसि माणवका॒॒ ३ ॥  Here the final of माणवक becomes _anudatta_ and _pluta_.
