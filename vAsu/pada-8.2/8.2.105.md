sutra: अनन्त्यस्यापि प्रश्नाख्यानयोः
vRtti: अनन्त्यस्यापि अन्त्यस्यापि पदस्य टेः प्लुतो भवति प्रश्ने आख्याने च ॥
vRtti_eng: "In a question or narration, the end-vowel of a word, though not final in a sentence, becomes _svarita_ and _pluta_, as well as of the word which is final in a sentence."
---
The word '_padasya_' is understood here: and so also the word '_svarita_'. The end-vowel of a word which is not the last word in a sentence, as well as of the last word, becomes _svarita_ and _pluta_, when a question is asked, or a fact is narrated. In fact, all the words of a sentence become _svarita_ and _pluta_ hereby.

Thus in questioning we have:- आगमा॑३ः पूर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् अग्निभूता॑३इ or पटा३उ ॥ Thus all words have become _svarita_ and _pluta_. The final word would, in one alternative, become _anudatta_ also, by (VIII. 2. 100), as shown under that _sutra_. The force of the word अपि in the _sutra_, is to make the final word also _svarita_, and thus this _sutra_ makes (VIII. 2. 100) an optional _sutra_ with regard to question.

In _akhyana_ or narration, there is no other rule, which is debarred by this. Therefore there, all words become _svarita_ and _pluta_ necessarily, by the force of this _sutra_. Thus आगमा॑३ः पुर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् भोः॑३ ॥

Another view of this _sutra_ is that the word अपि applies only to _akhyana_, so that in _akhyana_ all words become _svarita_. But in _prasna_, the final word will not become _svarita_, but _anudatta_ necessarily by (VIII. 2. 100). According to this view, this _sutra_ does not ordain option. This view is not adopted by _Kasika_, or _Padamanjari_ or _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_.
