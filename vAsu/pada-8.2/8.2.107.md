sutra: एचोऽप्रगृह्यस्यादूराद्धूते पूर्वस्यार्द्धस्यादुत्तरस्येदुतौ
vRtti: एचोऽप्रगृह्यस्यादूराद्धूते प्लुतविषयस्यार्द्धस्याकार आदेशो भवति स च प्लुतः उत्तरस्येकारोकारावादेशो भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "In the diphthongs, which are not _Pragrhya_ (I. 1. 11) &c)) and which become _pluta_ under the circumstances mentioned in (VIII. 2. 83) &c., but not when that circumstance is a call from a distance (VIII. 2. 84); for the first half, there is substituted the prolated आ, and for the second portion इ or उ ॥"
---
The diphthongs or एच् are ए, ऐ, ओ and औ ॥ Their elements are अ + इ, and अ + उ ॥ When these diphthongs are to be prolated, at the end of a word, the diphthong is resolved into its elements, the first portion अ is prolated, and इ or उ added, as the case may be. This इ and उ, in fact, are the substitutes of the second portion, which may be इ or उ, or ए or ओ ॥

This rule is not of universal application, but applies to Rules (VIII. 2. 100), (VIII. 2. 97), (VIII. 2. 83), and (VIII. 2. 90) only, according to the

Vart:- The scope of this _sutra_ should be determined by enumerating the rules to which it applies.

Vart:- It should be stated that it applies to _sutras_ (VIII. 2. 100), (VIII. 2. 97), (VIII. 2. 83) and (VIII. 2. 90).

Thus (VIII. 2. 100): As अगमा३: पूर्वा३न् ग्रामा३न् अग्निभूता३इ꣡ ॥ or पटा३उ꣡ ॥ भद्रं करोषि माणवका३ अग्निभूता३इ꣡ or पटा३उ꣡ ॥ So also (VIII. 2. 97): होतव्यं दीक्षितस्य गृहा꣡३इ꣡ ॥ So also (VIII. 2. 83), as :- आयुष्मान् एधि अग्निभूता꣡३इ꣡ or पटा꣡३उ꣡ ॥ So also (VIII. 2. 90):- as.

उक्षाम्नाय वशाम्नाय सोमपृष्ठाय वेधसे ।
स्तोमैर्विधेमाग्नया३इ꣡ ॥ (_Taitiriya_ _Samhita_. I. 3. 14. 7).

This _pluta_ आ is _udatta_, _anudatta_ or _svarita_, according to the particular rule which has been applied, i. e. at the end of a question it is _anudatta_ or _svarita_, and every where else, _udatta_. The इ and उ are of course, always _udatta_ : because the _anuvritti_ of _udatta_ is current here.

Why do we restrict this sutra_ to the above-mentioned four rules? Observe विष्णुभूते विष्णुभूते३ घातयिष्यामि त्वा आगच्छ भो माणवक विष्णुभूते ॥

In fact, the present _sutra_ being confined to the above-mentioned four rules, the words अदूराद्धूते in the _sutra_, are redundant: and should not have been used. Moreover the word पदान्त should have been used in the _sutra_, for it applies to diphthongs at the end of a _pada_. Therefore, not here, भद्रं करोषि गौरिति ॥ Here गौ before the _sarvanamasthana_ affix सु is not a _Pada_ (I. 4. 17).

Why do we say 'when it is not a _Pragrhya_'? Observe शोभने खलु स्थःखट्वे३ ॥

Vart:- This peculiar modification of _pluta_ vowel takes place in the Vocative case in the Vedas. As अग्ना३इ पत्नीवा३: सजूर्देवेन त्वष्ट्रा सोमं पिब ॥ Here by no other rule, the Vocative would have become prolated.
