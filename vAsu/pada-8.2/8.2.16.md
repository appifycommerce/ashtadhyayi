sutra: अनो नुट्
vRtti: छन्दसीति वर्ततेऽनन्तादुत्तरस्य मतोर्नुडागमो भवति छन्दसि विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix मत् gets the augment नुट्, in the _Chhandas_, after a stem ending in अन् ॥

As अक्षण्वन्तः कर्णवन्तः सखायः; अस्थन्वन्तं यदनस्था बिभर्त्ति (_Rig_. I.164.4), अक्षण्वता लाङ्गलेन; शीर्षण्वती, मूर्द्धन्वती ॥

The word अक्षण्वत् is thus formed : अक्षि + मतुप् = अक्ष् + अन् + मत् (अनङ् is substituted for the final of _akshi_ by (VII. I. 76)) = अक्षमत् (the म् is elided by (VIII.2.7)). Now we add the augment नुट् ॥ If this augment is added to मतुप्, as म्मतुप् then it becomes a portion of मतुप्, and this म् would be changed to व by (VIII.3.9) read with (I. I. 54), and not the letter म्, because म् intervenes. If we add this augment to the end of the stem, then in अक्षण्वता &c. we cannot change it to ण because of the prohibition in (VIII.4.37), and the augment being नुक्, the न् would be changed to र् by (VIII.3.7) in सुपथिन्तरः &c (VIII.2.17). The first view, however, is the correct one and the difficulty in its acceptance is obviated by नुटोऽसिद्धत्वात् तस्य च वत्वं न भवति; ततः परस्य च भवति; as shown above.

The नुट् augment being considered as _asiddha_, is not changed to व, but the letter following it, is so changed. Thus अक्षन् (VII. I. 76) + मत् = अक्ष + मत् (the न् of the stem is elided by (VIII.2.7). Add the augment नुट् now, and we have अक्ष + न्मत् ॥ The augment according to (VIII.2.1), is _asiddha_, so that according to (VIII.2.9), व् is substituted for म्, and not for न्, as would have been required by (I. I. 54).
