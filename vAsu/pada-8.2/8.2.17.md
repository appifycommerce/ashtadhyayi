sutra: नाद् घस्य
vRtti: नकारान्तादुत्तरस्य घसंज्ञकस्य नुडागमो भवति छन्दसि विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: "In the _Chhandas_, the affixes तर and तम receive the augment नुट् after a stem in न् ॥"
---
The affixes तरप् and तमप् are called घ ॥ Thus सुपथिन् + तर = सुपथि + तर (VIII. 2. 7) = सुपथि + न्तर (VIII. 2. 17) = सुपथिन्तरः ॥ So also दस्युहन्तमः ॥

Vart:- The augment तुट् is added to these affixes after भूरिदावन्; as भूरिदावत्तरः ((III. 2. 74), the affix is वनिप्).

Vart:- Long ई is the substitute of the final of रथिन् before तर and तम ॥ The word रथिन् is formed by the affix इनि in the sense of मतुप् ॥ The final न् is first elided by (VIII. 2. 7), and then for the short इ of रथि the long ई is substituted by the present _vartika_. If the long ई were substituted for the final न् of रथिन् as रथिई + तर, then this long ई being _asiddha_, it could not be compounded by _ekadesa_ with the preceding इ into ई, and the form would always remain रथिईतरः ॥ As रथीतरः, and रथीतमं रथीनाम् ॥ Or this ई may be considered to have come after रथ in the sense of मतुप् ॥
