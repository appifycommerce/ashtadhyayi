sutra: झलो झलि
vRtti: झल उत्तरस्य सकारस्य झलि परतो लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The स् is elided when it is preceded by a _jhal_ consonant (any consonant except semi-vowels and nasals), and is followed by an affix beginning with a _jhal_ consonant.

Thus अभित्त for अभित्स्त, अभित्थाः for अभित्स्थाः ॥ So also अच्छित्त, अच्छित्थाः, अवात्ताम्, अवात्त ॥ The last example may also be explained by (VII.4.49); the elision of the स of सिच् being considered as _asiddha_, the स् of the root is changed to त् ॥

Why do we say 'of a _jhal_ consonant'? Observe अमंस्त and अमंस्थाः ॥ Why do we say followed by a _jhal_ consonant ? Observe अभित्साताम्, अभित्सत ॥

The स of this _sutra_ refers also to the स of सिच्; no other स is elided. As सोममसुत् स्तोता; दृषत् स्थानम् ॥ Here the स of स्तोता and स्थानं, though preceded by a _jhal_ letter त्, could never be elided as they do not form portion of one word.
