sutra: नहो धः
vRtti: नहो हकारस्य धकारादेशो भवति झलि परतः पदान्ते च ॥
vRtti_eng: "The ह of नह् is changed to ध before a _jhal_ letter or at the end of a word."

As नद्धा, नद्धुम्, नद्धव्यम्, उपानत्, परीणत् ॥ The त् of the affixes तृ &c, is changed to ध by (VIII. 2. 40); and for the preceding ध is substituted द by (VIII. 4. 53). उपानत् is formed by (VIII. 2. 39), read with (VIII. 4. 56). परीणत् is formed by क्विप् as it belongs to सम्पदादि class, the lengthening is by (VI. 3. 116), and ण-change by (VIII. 4. 14). It would have shortened the processes of transformation, had only द been ordained in the _sutra_, instead of ध; but the ordaining of ध is for the purposes of (VIII. 2. 40), by which there should be ध for the participial त &c, in नद्धम्, and that there should not be the change of this _Nishtha_ त into म by (VIII. 2. 42). Thus नध् + त = नध् + ध (VIII. 2. 40) नद्धम् (VIII. 4. 53) But had the substitute been द, we should have नद् + त = नन्नं by (VIII. 2. 42).
