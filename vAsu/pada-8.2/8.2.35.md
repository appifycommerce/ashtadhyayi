sutra: आहस्थः
vRtti: आहो हकारस्य थकारादेशो भवति झलि परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "For the ह of the root आह्, there is substituted थ before a _jhal_ letter."

As इदमात्थ, किमात्थ ॥ The word आथ्थ becomes आत्थ by (VIII. 4. 55). Why has the last mentioned substitute ध not been ordained here, for this ध would also have given the form आत्थ by चर change, as the थ is also changed to त; and by so doing there would have been only one _sutra_, instead of two i.e. आहनहो र्ध would have been enough? Making this separate substitute, is for the sake of indicating that the rule (VIII. 2. 40), does not apply here. For had (VIII. 2. 40), still applied, the substitute ध of the last _sutra_ would have been enough. The त substitute, however, would have been the best.

The word झलि is understood here. Hence there is no change before vowel affixes, as आह, आहतुः, आहुः ॥

Vart:- In the _Chhandas_, भ is substituted for the ह of हृ and ग्रह ॥ Thus गर्दभेन संभरति; मरुदस्य गृभ्णाति; सामिधेन्यो जभ्रिरे, उद्ग्राभञ्च निग्राभञ्च ब्रह्म देवा अवीवृधन् ॥
