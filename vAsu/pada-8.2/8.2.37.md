sutra: एकाचो बशो भष् झषन्तस्य स्ध्वोः
vRtti: धातोरवयवो य एकाच् झषन्तः तदवयवस्य बशः स्थाने भष् आदेशो भवति झलि सकारे ध्वशब्दे च परतः पदान्ते च ॥
vRtti_eng: "For the letters ब, ग, ड or द in the beginning of a monosyllable, and belonging to a root, and which ends in झ, भ, घ, ढ or ध, there is substituted भ, घ, ढ or ध  respectively, before स or ध्व, or at the end of a _pada_ (word)."

Thus from बुध् - भोत्स्यन्ते, अभुध्वम् and अर्थभुत्; from गुह् - नि घोक्ष्यते न्यघुढ्वम्, पर्णघुट् ॥ गुह् becomes गुढ् by (VIII. 2. 31), and thus it is a root ending in, _jhash_. From दुह् - (which becomes दुघ् by (VIII. 2. 32), and thus is a _jhash_ ending root) धोक्ष्यते, अदुग्ध्वम्, गोधुक् ॥

So also from गृध् we have अजर्घाः the 2nd Person Singular Imperfect (लङ्) Intensive (_yan_ _luk_). There is _guna_ of ऋ, the स् (of सिप् 2nd Person Singular) is elided (VI. 1. 68), and we have अजर्गर्ध्, and for the letter ग of the monosyllabic root, घ is substituted by the present aphorism. अजर्घर्ध् ॥ Then the final ध् is changed to द्, अजर्घर्द् (VIII. 2. 39). Then द् is changed to र् by (VIII. 2. 75). अजर्घर्र् ॥ Then the first र् is elided अजर्घर् (VIII. 3. 14). Then there is lengthening by (VI. 3. 111), and we have अजर्घाः ॥

The monosyllable should be such that it should begin with a षश् and end with a झष् letter, and should be a full root or the portion (अवयव) of a root. In fact, this word which we found necessary in (VIII. 2. 32), is absolutely necessary here, in order to explain forms like गर्धप् from the Denominative root गर्दभय, by former क्विप् ॥

Why do we say "a monosyllable beginning with बश् and ending with झष् ?" Observe दामलिट् from the Denominative root दामलिह्म ॥ For had एकाचः not been employed in the _sutra_, the word धातोः (VIII. 2. 32) would have qualified बशः and the _sutra_ would have meant "in a root which ended in a _jhash_, and which contained a बश् letter as its member; there is _jhash_ substitution for such बश्", and the द of दामलिह would be changed then.

Why do we say "for a बश् letter"? Observe क्रुध् – क्रोत्स्यति here क is not changed to ष ॥ Why do we say ending in _jhash_? Observe दास्यति ॥ Why before स and ध्व? Observe बोद्धा, बोद्धुम्, बोद्धव्यम् ॥

Why have we taken ध्व and not merely ध? Observe दादद्धि from दध् in the यङ् लुक्, Imperative 2nd Person singular, the हि being changed to धि (VI. 4. 101). The substitutes are four भ, घ, ड and ध, and their respective _sthanins_ are also four, i. e. ब, ग, ड and द; so that ढ is the substitute of ड; but, as a matter of fact, ड never so stands at the beginning of a monosyllable, and so there is no ढ substitution.
