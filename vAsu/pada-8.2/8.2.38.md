sutra: दधस्तथोश्च
vRtti: दध इति दधातिः कृतद्विर्वचनो निर्दिश्यते । तस्य झलन्तस्य बशः स्थाने भष् आदेशो भवति तकारथकारयोः परतश्चकारात् स्ध्वोश्च परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "For the द of दध (the reduplicated form of धा) is substituted ध, before the affixes beginning with त, थ, स and before ध्वम् ॥"
---
The word दध is taken in the _sutra_ as the reduplicated form of धा दधाति and not the root दध धारणे of _Bhuadi_ class, as शप् intervenes there. By the word च we draw in the words स and ध्व ॥ Thus धत्तः, धत्थः, धत्स, धत्स्व, धध्वम् ॥ By the express injunction of this _sutra_, the elided अ is not considered as _sthanivat_. The last _sutra_ could not have applied to दध for two reasons. Ist. It does not begin with a बश् letter, for the real reduplicate is धध, and ह is merely a substitute, and is considered _asiddha_. 2ndly. The form दध does not end in a _jhash_ consonant, but in a vowel अ, and though this अ is elided before these affixes, yet the _lopa_ would be _sthanivat_. Hence the necessity of च in this _sutra_. See coutra, the _vartika_ in _Mahabhashya_.

The word झलि is understood here, and so also झषन्तस्य; and there can be no affix, but begins with त or थ, that can come after दध् ॥ Why do we employ then the words 'before त and थ'? Had we not used these, the _sutra_ would have referred to स and ध्व only, as being in immediate proximity, and the च draws them in. According to _Padamanjari_ the words तथोश्च could have been dispensed with: for before स् and ध्व, the ध change would have taken place by the last _sutra_, whilst by this _sutra_, the same change would have taken place before all other झल्-beginning affixes, and such affixes that can come after दध् are त or थ-beginning affixes.

The word _jhash_ is understood here also, therefore the rule applies to दध then only, when it assumes the form of दध्, by the elision of आ; and hence not here दधाति ॥
