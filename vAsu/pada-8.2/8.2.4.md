sutra: उदात्तस्वरितयोर्यणः स्वरितोऽनुदात्तस्य
vRtti: उदात्तयणः स्वरितयणश्च परस्यानुदात्तस्य स्वरित आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "A _svarita_ vowel is the substitute of an _anudatta_ vowel, when the latter follows after such a semi-vowel, which has replaced an _udatta_ or a _svarita_ vowel."
---
An unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_, when it comes after a यण् (semi-vowel), which यण् itself has come in the room of a vowel which was acute or _svarita_ once.

Let us first take the vowel following an _udatta_ _yan_. Thus कुमा॒र्यौ॑, कुमा॒॑र्यः ॥ The word कुमारी꣡ is acutely accented on the final, because the long ई (ङीप्) replaces अ꣡ of कुमार (VI. 1. 161). The semi-vowel य् is substituted in the room of this acute ई꣡; the _anudatta_ आ and अः become _svarita_ after such a य् ॥

Now to take an example of a _svarita_-_yan_. The words सकृल्लू꣡ and खलपू꣡ are finally acute by _krit_-accent (VI. 2. 139). The Locative singular of these words are खलपू꣡ + इ॒ = खल्पिवं, and सकृल्ल्वि by (VI. 4. 83). This व् is a semi-vowel which comes in the room of the acute ऊ꣡, therefore, it is _udatta_-_yan_. After this _udatta_-_yan_, the _anudatta_ इ of the Locative becomes _svarita_ by the first part of this _sutra_. Now when खलप्वि॑ + आशा꣡ and सकृल्ल्वि॑ + आशा꣡ are combined by _sandhi_, this _svarita_ इ is changed to य्; it is, therefore, a _svarita_-_yan_. The unaccented आ will become _svarita_, after this _svarita_-_yan_. As खलप्व्या॑शा and सकृल्ल्व्या॑शा ॥ The word आशा is finally acute and consequently आ is not acute (_Phit_. I. 18).

Objection:- Here an objector may say: that the _svarita_ accent on इ in खलप्वि is by this very _sutra_, this _svarita_ is to be considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of यण् _adesa_ of (VI. 4. 83). How can then the य् substituted for this इ be considered as _svarita_-_yan_?

Answer:- This is considered as _siddha_ by _asraya_. (आश्रयात् सिद्धत्वम्) ॥

Objection :-If this be so, then उदात्तादनुदात्तस्य स्वरितः (VIII. 4. 66) should also be considered as _siddha_: and we should have _svarita_ in दध्याशा &c also. For the word द꣡धि is first-acute by _Phit_ Il. 3. Therefore धि is _svarita_ by (VIII. 4. 66). The य् is _svarita_ _yan_, the _anudatta_ आ after this should become _svarita_ according this view, but this is not so.

Answer:- To avoid this difficulty, we have the following.

Vart:- यण्स्वरो यणादेशो सिद्धो वक्तव्यः ॥ "The यण् accent should be considered as valid, for the purposes of यण् substitution".

Some say, that even in such cases as दध्या॑शा the above rule applies, and that the unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_, if it follows a _svarita_-_yan_ which is preceded by an acute vowel. They quote the following from _Taittariya_ _sakha_ : यास्ते विश्वाः समिधः सन्त्यग्ने, where the अ of अग्ने is pronounced as _svarita_. So also in the _Brahmana_ portion as : दध्या॑शयति the आ is read as _svarita_. But according to _Katyayana_ and _Patanjali_, the unaccented vowel does not become _svarita_ by this _sutra_, when it follows a _svarita_-_yan_ which is preceded by an acute vowel.

To get rid of these anomalies, the _Mahabhashya_ proposes several alternatives, two of which will be mentioned here. The first proposal is to divide this composite _sutra_ into two parts: (1) उदात्तयणः परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति "an unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_ when it follows after an _udatta_ _yan_". (2) स्वरितयणश्च परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति "an unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_, when following a _svarita_ _yan_" and in this second _sutra_, we shall read the _anuvritti_ of _udatta_-_yan_ from the preceding half. So that this half will mean: उदात्तयण इत्येवं यो निर्वृत्तः स्वरितः, तस्य यणः परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति ॥ The _svarita_ must have been obtained by the application of the first half of this _sutra_ and this _svarita_ should be changed to यण्, which would change the _anudatta_ into _svarita_. So that the स्वरित यणः means this particular _svarita_ obtained by the application of this very _sutra_.

The second proposal is not to read _svarita_ into the _sutra_ at all. The _svarita_ in सकृल्ल्व्या॑शा would then be explained by _udatta_-_yanah_ rule. सकृल्लू + इ + आशा = सकृल्ल्व् + य् + आशा ॥ Here व् is _udatta_-_yan_. This will cause आ to become _svarita_. The intervening _svarita_ य् is considered as not existent for the purposes of accent स्वरविधौव्यञ्जनमविद्यमानवत् ॥ Nor is this य् to be considered as _sthani_-_vad_ to इ by (I. 1. 57), for in applying the rule of accent, such a substitute is not considered as _sthanivat_ by (I. 1. 58).

Why do we say " of _udatta_ and _svarita_"? Observe बैदी꣡ + आशा꣡ = बैद्याशा, so also शार्ङ्गव्याशा ॥ Here the semi-vowel replaces an unaccented ई, and is अनुदात्त यण् ॥ These words are first acute owing to नित् accent (IV. 1. 73).

Why do we say "an unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_"? Observe कुमार्यत्र, किशोर्यत्र ॥ The word अ꣡त्र is acutely accented on the first by लित् accent. (VI. 1. 193).
