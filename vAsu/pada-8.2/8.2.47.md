sutra: श्योऽस्पर्शे
vRtti: श्यायतेरुत्तरस्य निष्ठातकारस्यास्पर्शे नकार आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The _Nishtha_ त is changed to न after श्यै, but not when the Participle denotes 'cold'."

Thus शीनं घृतम्, शीनो मेदः, शीना वसा; but शीतं वर्तते, शीतो वायुः, शीतमुदकम् ॥ The य् of श्या is vocalised to ई by (VI. 1. 24).

The prohibition applies when the noun is an adjective and means 'cold'; and not when it means a disease. Therefore we have प्रतिशीनः with न change.

The word स्पर्श is a _guna_ word formed by घञ्, and denotes the particular _guna_ or sensation to be sensed through the organ of touch. In this sense it is derived from the root स्पृश संस्पर्शने ॥ It also denotes a disease, derived from स्पर्श उपतापे ॥ There is nothing to show, what स्पर्श is meant in the _sutra_. Explanation is the only refuge here.
