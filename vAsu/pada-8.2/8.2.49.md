sutra: दिवोऽविजिगीषायाम्
vRtti: दिव उत्तरस्य निष्ठातकारस्य नकारादेशो भवति अविजिगीषायामर्थे ॥
vRtti_eng: "The _Nishtha_ त is changed to न, after दिव्, when the sense is not that of 'play'."

The word विजिगीषा means "desire of conquest or gain", but here it means "gambling".

Thus आद्यूनः, = औदरिकः, परिद्यूनः क्षीणः ॥ Why do we say. "when it does not mean to play"? Observe द्यूतं वर्तते ॥ Here the throwing of dice is with the desire of winning or gaining victory (_vijigisha_) over the opponent.
