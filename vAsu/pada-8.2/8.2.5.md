sutra: एकादेश उदात्तेनोदात्तः
vRtti: उदात्तेन सहानुदात्तस्य य एकादेशः स उदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The single substitute of an unaccented with an _udatta_ vowel is _udatta_."
---
The word "of an _anudatta_" is understood here. An unaccented vowel, which combined with the preceding _udatta_ vowel remains as a single substitute, becomes _udatta_. Thus for the _udatta_ इ of अग्नि꣡ and for the case-ending औ which is _anudatta_, there is always substituted long ई single by (VI. 1. 102). This single substitute will be _udatta_ according to the present sutra_, as अग्नी꣡ ॥ Similarly वायू꣡, वृक्षैः꣡, प्लक्षैः꣡ ॥

Why do we say "with _udatta_ vowel"? Observe पचन्ति, यजन्ति ॥ Here पच् + शप् + अन्ति = प꣡च् + अ + अन्ति । Here शप् is _anudatta_ by (III. 1. 4), so also अन्ति by (VI. 1. 186). The _ekadesa_ of these two non-accented अ will be _anudatta_. In forming this _para_-_rupa_ _ekadesa_ by (VI. 1. 97), the _svarita_ of the अ of शप् caused by (VIII. 4. 66) is considered as invalid or _asiddha_.

Other examples are क्व वोऽश्वाः (_Rig_. V. 61. 2) and क्वावरं मरुतः ॥ The word वः is _anudatta_ by (VIII. 1. 21). read with (VIII. 1. 18). The word अ꣡श्वः is acutely accented on the first, as it is formed by adding क्वन् to अश् (_Unadi_ I. 151). The स् of वस् is changed to व् (VIII. 2. 66), which is again changed to उ (VI. 1. 113). Thus वोऽश्वः ॥ Here अ becomes _purva_-_rupa_ by (VI. I. 109), which is _udatta_. क्व is formed from किम् by अत् affix (V. 3. 12) and (VII. 2. 105) and is _svarita_ (VI. 1. 185). The word अ꣡वर is acutely accented on the first by the _Phit_ II. 6. The single long substitute is _udatta_.
