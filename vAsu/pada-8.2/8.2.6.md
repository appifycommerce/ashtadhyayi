sutra: स्वरितो वाऽनुदात्ते पदादौ
vRtti: अनुदात्ते पदादौ उदात्तेन सह य एकादेशः स स्वरितो वा भवत्युदात्तो वा ॥
vRtti_eng: "The single substitute of an unaccented vowel, standing at the beginning of a word, with an _udatta_ vowel, may optionally be _svarita_ or _udatta_."

Thus सु + उत्थितः = सू꣡त्थितः or सू॑त्थितः; वि॑ + ईक्षते = वीक्ष꣡ते or वीक्ष॑ते; वसुकः + असि = वसुकोऽ॑सि or वसुकोऽ꣡सि ॥ Here the word सु is a _Karmapravachaniya_  by (I. 4. 94), when it is compounded by प्रादिसमास with the Past Participle, the _Avayayibhava_ compound retains the accent of its first member (VI. 2. 2), and so it is acutely accented on the first, and the rest are _anudatta_. Thus the _udatta_ उ꣡ of सु is compounded with the _anudatta_ उ॒॒ of उत्थितः which stands at the beginning of a _Pada_, and so the _ekadesa_ is optionally _svarita_. In वीक्षते and वसुकोऽसि also the verbs ईक्षते and असि lose all accent by (VIII. 1. 28) and so ई and अ become _anudatta_, which when compounded with वि and वसुका become optionally _svarita_.

The word स्वरितः is employed in the _sutra_ only for the sake of distinctness, for the _sutra_ may have well stood as वाऽनुदात्ते पदादौ ॥ In this form of the _sutra_, the _udatta_ of the preceding _sutra_ would become optional when the second member is a word beginning with _anudatta_. _Udatta_ being optional, in the other alternative, where there will not be _udatta_, the _svarita_ will be substituted by reason of the nearness in position.

Why do we say "_anudatta_ beginning"? Observe देवदत्तोऽत्र ॥ Here अत्र begins with _udatta_ and not _anudatta_, and hence no option is allowed.

Why do we say "beginning of a word"? Observe वृक्षैः, वृक्षाः, प्लक्षैः and प्लक्षाः, where _anudatta_ case-endings are not beginnings of words.

According to _Bhattoji_ _Dikshita_ this is a _vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_; in this wise. There will necessarily be _svarita_ (1) where a long ई is the single substitute of (इ + इ) or of two short इ, (2) where there is _purva_-_rupa_ by the application of एङपदान्तात् अति (VI. 1. 109). There will be _udatta_ where a long vowel comes in. Thus in वि + इदम् = वीद॑म् in वी३दं॒॒ ज्योति॒॒र्हृद॑ये, the long ई is substituted for two short इ's. This substitution of a long ई for two short इ's is technically called प्रश्लेष ॥ Where there is _Praslesha_, the long ई is necessarily _svarita_. Similarly when there is अभिनिहतसन्धिः i. e. the peculiar _sandhi_ taught in (VI. 1. 109). Thus ते॑ऽवदन्, सोऽय॒॒मागा॑त् ॥ So also where there is क्षैप्रः सन्धिः i.e. the substitution of a semi-vowel in the room of an _udatta_ or _svarita_ vowel, as अन्या॑भि ॥ The above rules about _svarita_ are thus summarised in the _Pratisakhyas_ : इकारयोश्च प्रश्लेषे क्षैप्राभिनिहतेषु च ॥ But where a long ई is substituted as a single substitute for इ + ई (one of the इ's being long), there it must always be acute. As अस्य श्लोको दि॒॒वीयते (_Rig_. 1. 190. 4). The words दिवि꣡ + ईय॒॒ते॒॒ are compounded into दिवीयते ॥ The word दिवि꣡ Locative singular is finally acute by (VI. 1. 171). ईयते is from the _Divadi_ root इङ् गतौ, and has lost its accent by (VIII. 1. 28).
