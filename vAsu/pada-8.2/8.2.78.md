sutra: उपधायां च
vRtti: धातोरुपधाभूतो यौ रेफवकारौ हल्परौ तयोरुपधाया इको दीर्घो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The short इ or उ of a root is lengthened, when the verb has र् or व् as its penultimate letter, and is followed by a consonant."
---
The _anuvritti_ of हलि is current. The root must end in a consonant, and must have a र् or व् as preceding such consonant, for the application of this rule. Thus हूर्छा, हूर्छिता, मूर्छा, मूर्छिता, तूर्वी, तूर्विता, धूर्वी, धूर्विता ॥

The र् or व् must be followed by a consonant. Therefore not here: as, चिरि, जिरि are roots having a penultimate र, which however is followed by a vowel. Therefore we have चिरिणोति, जिरिणोति ॥

Question:- Why there is not lengthening in रिर्यतुः, रिर्युः or विव्यतुः, विव्युः Perfect, forms derived from the roots रि गतौ and वी गतौ &c? Here the इ of the _abhyasa_ required lengthening, and it would not be shortened, as it is _asiddha_.

Answer:- The यण् substitute of इ here by (VI. 4. 82), is treated as _sthanivat_, to इ, and therefore, the र् or व् is considered as not to be followed by a consonant, and hence there is no lengthening. Another reason is, that the यण् substitute is taught in _angadhikara_ (VI. 4. 82), and depends upon the affix, and is consequently _Bahiranga_, with regard to this rule of lengthening which is _antaranga_. Hence यणादेशः is considered as _asiddha_. Therefore र् and व् are not followed by a consonant (for य् is not considered as such for the above reasons).

Similarly in चतुर्यितृ formed with तृच् affix from the Denominative (क्यच्) root चतुर्य ॥ Here इट् is added before तृच् as चतुर्य + इ + तृ and then अ is elided, चतुर्य् + इ + तृ ॥ Here the elision of अ is a _Bahiranga_ process, and therefore, र् is not here really penultimate, and so there is no lengthening of the vowel.

In प्रतिदीव्ना (Instrumental singular) there is lengthening by (VIII. 2. 77). To the root प्रति-दिव् is added कनिन् by _Unadi_ I. 156, and we have प्रतिदिवन् ॥ To this is added टा (Instrumental affix), as प्रतिदिवन् + आ, and अ is elided by (VI. 4. 134), and we get प्रतिदीव्ना ॥ The lengthening takes place here, the elision of अ is not considered here as _sthanivat_, and so व् becomes penultimate. In fact, here we apply the maxim that a _lopa_ substitute of a vowel is not to be considered as _sthanivat_ when a rule of lengthening is to be applied (See (I. 1. 58)).

Question:- Well, let it not be _sthanivat_, but the elision by (VI. 4. 134), depends upon a case-affix, and is _Bahiranga_, and therefore _asiddha_ for the purposes of this rule which is _antaranga_: and so therefore, there would be no lengthening?

Answer:- The maxim of असिद्ध बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्ग should not be applied here: because it is an _anitya_ rule.

The word जिव्रिः is formed by the _Unadi_ affix क्रिन् added to the root वॄ (जिर्), the र् being changed to व (_Unadi_ V. 49). So also किरिः and गिरिः are formed by the _Unadi_ affix कि added to कॄ and गॄ (_Unadi_ IV. 143). The Genitive Dual of which is किर्योः and गिर्योः ॥ There is no lengthening in जिव्रिः, किर्योः and गिर्योः, on the maxim that the _Unadi_ formed words are primitive words and not Derivative; and so the rules of etymological changes do not apply to them (उणादयोऽव्युत्पन्नानि प्रातिपदिकानि) ॥
