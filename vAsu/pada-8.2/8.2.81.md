sutra: एत ईद्बहुवचने
vRtti: अदसो दकारादुत्तरस्य एकारस्य ईकारादेशो भवति दकारस्य च मकारः बहुवचने बहूनामर्थानामुक्तौ ॥
vRtti_eng: "For the ए coming after the द of अदस्, there is substituted ई, and द् is changed to म्, when plurality is to be expressed."

Thus अमी for अदे (or अते) अमीभिः for अदेभिः, अमीभ्यः for अदेभ्यः, अमीषाम् for अदेषाम्, अमीषु for अदेषु ॥ द is changed to त in अते &c.

The word बहुवचने in the _sutra_ does not mean the technical बहुवचन; for that would have made the _sutra_ have this sense "when the affixes of the Plural number follow". In that case, we could not get the form अमी where no plural affix follows. Hence we have translated it, by saying when plurality is to be denoted.
