sutra: दूराद्धूते च
vRtti: दूराद्धूते यद्वाक्यं वर्त्तते तस्य टेः प्लुतो भवति स चोदात्तः ॥ इष्टिः ॥ वाक्यस्यान्ते यत्र सम्बोधनपदं भवति, तत्र अयं प्लुत इष्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The final vowel of a sentence becomes _pluta_ and acute, when used in calling a person from a distance.

---
The word दूरात् is in the Fifth case by (II.3.35); the word  हूतं means 'calling', 'addressing'. Thus आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्ता ३ ॥ आगच्छ भो माणवक यज्ञदत्ता ३ ॥ The word 'distance' is a relative term, and is not fixed at what distance there should be prolation. The prolation however takes place, when a voice is to be raised, in order that the sound may reach the person. That distance upto which the voice can be heard without raising its pitch and without any special effort, need not be considered as "distance" for the purposes of this _sutra_.

The word हूत here includes, 'addressing in general', and not only 'calling'. Thus there is prolation here also सक्तून् पिब देवदत्ता ३, पलायस्व देवदत्ता ३ ॥ This _pluta_ sentence becomes _eka_-_sruti_ by (I.2.33).

Why do we say "from a distance"? Observe आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्त !

_Ishti_:- This prolation takes place only then, when the noun in the vocative case stands at the end of the sentence. Therefore, there is no prolation here देवदत्त आगच्छ ॥
