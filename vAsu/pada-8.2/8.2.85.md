sutra: हैहेप्रयोगे हैहयोः
vRtti: हैहेप्रयोगे दूराद्धूते यद्वाक्यं वर्त्तते तत्र हैहयोरेव प्लुतो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When the words है and हे are employed, in addressing a person from a distance, there the है and हे alone get the _pluta_ and the accent.

As है ३ देवदत्त, देवदत्त है ३ ॥ हे ३ देवदत्त, देवदत्त हे ३ ॥

The repetition of the words है and हे in the _sutra_, is for the sake of indicating, that the prolation takes place even when है and हे do not stand at the end of a sentence.
