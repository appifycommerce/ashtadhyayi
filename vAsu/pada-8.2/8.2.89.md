sutra: प्रणवष्टेः
vRtti: यज्ञकर्म्मणि टेः प्रणव आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In a sacrificial work, ओ३म् is substituted for the final vowel, with the consonant, if any, that may follow it, of a sentence.

---
The word यज्ञकर्मणि is understood here also. The word प्रणव means ओम् ॥ It is the name given to this syllable. This ओम् is substituted for the final letter (टि) of that word which stands either at the end of a _Pada_ of a sacred hymns or at the end of a hemistich of such _Rik_. Thus for अ॒पां रेतां॑सि जिन्वति (_Rig_. VIII.44.16), we may have अपां रेतांसि जिन्वतो꣡ ३म् ॥ So also for दे॒वाञ् जिगा॑ति सु॒म्नयुः (_Rig_. III.27.1), we may have देवाञ् जिगाति सुम्नयो꣡ ३म् ॥

The word टि is repeated in this aphorism in spite of its _anuvritti_ from (VIII.2.82), to indicate that ओम् replaces the whole last syllable, with its vowel and consonant. Had टि not been repeated, then by the rule of अलोऽन्त्यस्य the final letter only of the टि portion of a sentence would have been replaced. Thus in सुम्नयुः, the _visarjaniya_ alone would have been replaced.

When not employed in connection with sacrificial works, there is no such substitution. Thus in simple reading of the Vedas, we should always recite अपां रेतांसि जिन्वति ॥
