sutra: याज्यान्तः
vRtti: याज्या नाम ये याज्याकाण्डे पठ्यन्ते मन्त्रास्तेषामन्त्यो यष्टिः स प्लवते यज्ञकर्मणि ॥
vRtti_eng: "The last vowel at the end of _Mantras_ called _Yajya_, when employed in sacrificial works, is _pluta_ and has the Acute."

Thus स्तोमैर्विधेमाग्नये३ (_Rig_. VIII. 43. II), जिह्वामग्ने चकृषे हव्यवाहा३म् (_Rig_. X. 8. 6).

Why do we say 'at the end'? There are some _Yajya_ hymns, consisting of several sentences. The final vowel (टि) of every sentence would have become _pluta_, in such a hymn. To prevent it, the word "_anta_" is used, so that the final vowel of the hymn at the end of all, becomes _pluta_.
