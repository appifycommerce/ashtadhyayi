sutra: आम्रेडितं भर्त्सने
vRtti: वाक्यादेरामन्त्रितस्येति भर्त्सने द्विर्वचनमुक्तं तस्याम्रेडितं प्लवते ॥
vRtti_eng: "The end syllable of an _amredita_ Vocative is _pluta_, when threat is expressed."
---
A Vocative is reiterated when threat is meant (VIII. 1. 8). Its final syllable becomes _pluta_. Thus चौर꣡ चौरा꣡३ घातिष्यामि त्वा ॥ So also वृषल वृषला꣡३ बन्धयिष्यामि त्वा, दस्य दस्यो३ &c.

Though the _anuvritti_ of the _sutra_ (VIII. 2. 82), is current here, yet the final of the sentence is not _pluta_, but of the _amredita_.

Vart:- It should be rather stated that any one of the repeated words may be _pluta_ by alternation. Thus चौरा꣡३ चौर or चौर꣡ चौरा꣡३ ॥ The word _amredita_ is employed in the _sutra_ as illustrative of the doubling, for threat is expressed by both words, so _pluta_ may be of both words in turn: and not of the second word only, though that is called technically _amredita_.
