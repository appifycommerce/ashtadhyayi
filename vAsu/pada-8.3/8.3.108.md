sutra: सनोतेरनः
vRtti: सनोतेरनकारान्तस्य सकारस्य मूर्द्धन्यादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The स of the verb सन्, when it loses its न्, is changed to ष, under the same circumstances.

Thus गोषाः (_Rig_. IX. 2. 10), formed by the affix विट (III.2.67), the न् is elided by (VI.4.41). So also नृषाः ॥

Why do we say 'when it loses its न्'? Observe गोसनिं वाचमुदीरयन् (_Atharvaveda_ III.20.10). Here the affix is इन् (III.2.27). See however गोषणिं in _Rig_. VI.53.10.

Though this ष change would have taken place by (VIII.3.106) also, the separate enumeration is for the sake of _niyama_ or restriction. Some however read the word गोसनिः in the list of सवनानि words (VIII.3.110), and they hold that the proper counter-example is सिसानयिषति ॥ So also सिसनीः formed by adding क्विप् to the Derivative root सिसनिस, thus सिसनिस + क्विप् = सिसनिस् (the अ is elided by (VI.4.48)) + 0. add सु, सिसनिस् + स् = सिसनिस् + 0 [स् is elided by (VI.1.68). Now the final स् (of the Desiderative affix सन्) is liable to be changed either to ष् or to र् (रु). The ष being _asiddha_, the रु change takes place.] = सिसनिर् = सिसनीः (the lengthening is by (VIII.2.76)). Here the Desiderative affix सन् is not changed to ष, hence this word is not governed by (VIII.3.61). This being the object of this _sutra_, there will be ष change in शिषाणयिषति in the Causative.
