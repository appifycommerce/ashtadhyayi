sutra: सात्पदाद्योः
vRtti: सादिति चैतस्य यङि परतो मूर्द्धन्यादेशो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The ष् substitution does not take place in the affix सात् and for that स which stands at the beginning of a word."

Thus सात् here is the affix ordained by (V. 4. 52), and it would have been changed to ष by (VIII. 3. 59). The present _sutra_ prevents that. The _Padadi_ स refers to those verbs which in the _Dhatupatha_ are taught with a ष, and for which a स is substituted. This also is an exception to (VIII. 3. 59). Thus अग्निसात् । दधिसात् । मधुसात् ॥ So also with _Padadi_ स as दधि सिञ्चति, मधु सिञ्चति ॥
