sutra: ढो ढे लोपः
vRtti: ढकारस्य ढकारे लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "There is elision of ढ् when ढ् follows."
---
Though this _sutra_ is read in the division of Grammar which is governed by पदाधिकार, yet this elision takes place only then when the ढ is not at the end of a _pada_. Thus लीढ from लिह् + त ॥ The ह is changed to  ढ by (VIII. 2. 31), and the त is first changed to ध by (VIII. 2. 40), and then to ढ by (VIII. 4. 41). Thus लिढ् + ढ ॥ The first ढ् is elided by this _sutra_. Similarly मीढम्, उपगूढम् ॥ The change of ध into ढ by (VIII. 4. 41), should be considered as valid and _siddha_ for the purposes of this rule, otherwise this rule will find no scope.

Objection:- It will find scope before that ढ which is primary, as in श्वलिढ् + ढौकते, where ढ of ढौकते is primary.

Answer:- No. Here the first ढ will be changed to ड् by जश् rule (VIII. 2. 39) and so there will be no occasion to elide it. The form will be श्वलिड् ढौकते ॥ Nor is this ढ लोपः rule an _apavada_ to जश्त्व rule, because it has its scope in लीढ &c. For the जश् rule depends upon one _pada_, and is _antaranga_, or being prior to this the _lopa_ is _asiddha_ with regard to it. Therefore जश्त्व will take place first. Moreover in लिढ् + ढ to there is similarity of sounds (श्रुतिकृतं आनन्तर्यम्); though there may not be theoretical similarity (शास्त्रकृतं आनन्तर्यम्) when the change of ध into ढ by (VIII. 4. 41), is considered _asiddha_. But this theoretical technical dissimilarity will be removed by the express text of the present _sutra_. But in श्वलिड् ढौकते there is neither similarity of sounds (_sruti_ _krtamanantaryam_) between ड् and ढ्, nor similarity created by any technical rule; therefore ढ लोप has no scope here. It is _Bahiranga_ as well as subsequent to जश् rule (VIII. 2. 39), and therefore doubly _asiddha_; and consequently it does not debar the जश् rule. So when ढ् is changed to ड् by जश् rule (VIII. 2. 39) in श्वलिड्, then there remains no sort of _anantarya_-neither of _sruti_ nor of _sastra_.
