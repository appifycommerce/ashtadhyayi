Thus पयःसु, सर्प्पिःषु, यशःसु ॥ The word सुप् is here the Locative Plural affix. Though the र् would have been changed to _visarga_ by the last _sutra_ also; the making of this a special _sutra_ is for the sake of _niyama_. That is, only रु becomes _visarga_, and not any other र् ॥ Thus गीर्षु, भूर्षु, when the र् is not रु ॥ In पयस् &c, the स् becomes रु by (8.2.66).
