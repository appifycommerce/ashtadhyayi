sutra: उञि च पदे
vRtti: अवर्णपूर्वयोः व्योः पदान्तयोर्लोपो भवति उञि च पदे परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: व् and य् (preceded by अ or आ, at the end of a _pada_), and followed by उ, when it is a word, are elided necessarily.

The particle उ is a full _pada_ or word. That Particle is meant here by the word उञ्, and not the उञ्, which is a root obtained by the _samprasarana_ of वेञ् ॥ Thus स उ एकविंशतिः, स उ एकाग्निः ॥

Why do we use the word पदे "उ when it is a _pada_"? So that the rule may not apply to उञ् the form assumed by वेञ् by _samprasarana_ as तन्त्रे उतं = तन्त्रयुतम् ॥ Objection:- उञ् could never have meant the form assumed by वेञ्, for the _samprasarana_ of वेञ् is उ, the ञ् is merely indicatory. Moreover the maxim of _lakshana_-_pratipadokta_ &c, will prevent the inclusion of this उञ् resulting from vocalisation, when there is a separate Particle उञ् ॥

Answer:- The word पदे is used here for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ like (8.3.32). So that ङ्मुट् may come before a word beginning with a vowel, and not before a vowel which is an affix. Thus there is no double in न् in परमदण्डिना ॥ This is also a _nitya_ rule, and not optional. Had it been optional, there would have been no necessity of this aphorism, because (8.3.19), would have been enough.
