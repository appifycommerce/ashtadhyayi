sutra: डः सि धुट्
vRtti: डकारान्तात्पदादुत्तरस्य सकारादेः पदस्य वा धुडागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After a word ending in ड्, there may optionally be added the augment ध् to a word beginning with स् ॥"
---
Thus श्वलिट् त्साये or श्वलिट् साये, or मधुलिट् त्साये or मधुलिट् साये ॥

The word डः is to be construed as Ablative singular, and not Genitive singular of ड्, because of the maxim उभयनिर्देशे पञ्चमी निर्देशो बलीयान् ॥

Question:- Why it is धुट् and not धुक्, in other words, why is this augment added to the beginning of the second word and not to the end of the first ?

Answer:- This is done in order to prevent the ष्टु change by (VIII. 4. 41). But being at the beginning of the second word, (VIII. 4. 42) would prevent this change. श्वलिट्त् + साये = श्वलिट्ट्साये, (VIII. 4. 41) but the correct form is श्वलिट् त्साये ॥ For the ह of श्वलिह् is ढ substituted by (VIII. 2. 31), which becomes ड् by (VIII. 2. 39), for the ध of the augment, त is substituted by (VIII. 4. 55), and for ड् there is ट् by the same rule.
