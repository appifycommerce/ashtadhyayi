sutra: नश्च
vRtti: नकारान्तात्पदादुत्तरस्य सकारस्य वा धुडागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a word ending in न्, धुट् is optionally the augment to a word beginning with स् ॥

Thus भवान् त्साये, महान् त्साये or भवान् साये, महान् साये ॥ The ध् of the augment becomes त् by (VIII.4.55). This त् is _asiddha_ (VIII.2.1), and therefore त् is not changed to रु by (VIII.3.7). This is the reason why the augment is exhibited as धुट् and not तुट् ॥ In _sutra_ (VIII.3.29) तुट् would have done as well but not so here. This view of the _Kasika_, however, is not approved by _Padamanjari_. The न् can never be changed to रु here, because त् is followed by स् which is not an अम् letter. The word अम्परे is understood in (VIII.3.7). In fact, तुट् would have been a better augment.
