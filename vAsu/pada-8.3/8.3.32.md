sutra: ङमो ह्रस्वादचि ङमुण्नित्यम्
vRtti: ह्रस्वात्परो यो ङम् तदन्तात्पदादुत्तरस्याचो ङमुडागमो भवति नित्यम् ॥ ङणनेभ्यो यथासंख्यं ङणना भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After a word ending in ङ्, ण् or न् which is preceded by a light vowel, the same consonant ङ्, ण् or न् is added invariably at the beginning of the next word, which commences with a vowel."
---
The word ङमः is in the Ablative singular here; and ह्रस्वात् qualifies ङमः and ङम् itself qualifies the word पदस्य understood, and thus there is _tadanta_-_viddhi_. Though the word पदस्य (VIII. 1. 16) is in the Genitive singular, yet it should be converted here into Ablative singular, because of its connection with ङमः ॥ अचि is in the Locative singular, but should be construed as Genitive singular here : it is exhibited in the 7th case for the sake of brevity, and of the subsequent _sutras_. ङम् is a _pratyahara_ meaning ङ, ण and न; and so also ङमुट् is a _pratyahara_ containing the three augments ङुट्, णुट् and नुट् ॥

In other words ङ् is augment after ङ्, ण् after ण् and न् after म्; or that these letters are doubled practically. Thus ङुट् is the augment after a word ending in ङ्, as प्रत्यङ्ङास्ते ॥ णुट् is the augment after a word ending in ण्, as वणणास्ते ॥ नुट् is the augment after a word ending in न्, as कुर्वन्नास्ते, कुर्वन्नवोचत्, कृषन्नास्ते, कृषन्नवोचत् ॥

Why do we say 'ending in ङ, ण or न'? See त्वमास्ते ॥ Why do we say 'preceded by a light vowel'? Observe प्राङास्ते, भवानास्ते ॥ Why do we say "followed by a vowel"? Observe प्रत्यङ्करोति ॥

The _Mahabhashya_ thus comments on this aphorism :-

Vart:- ङमुटि पदादिग्रहणम् "The ङमुट् augment is added to a vowel which stands at the beginning of a word". So that in दण्डिन् + आ (Instrumental Singular), नुट् is not added to आ, because it is not the beginning of a _Pada_. Then should this _vartika_ be held to be necessary? No, because the word पदात् is understood here: so नुट् will not come in दण्डिना ॥ But then it will come in परमदण्डिन् + आ ॥ Because it is a compound of two nouns, and though the case-affixes have been elided, yet दण्डिन् is here a _Pada_ by reason of _pratyaya_ _lakshana_; and hence there should be नुट् here added to आ ॥ Answer:- This is no valid objection. दण्डिन् is not here a _Pada_, on the maxim उत्तरपदत्वे चापदादिविधौलुमता लुप्ते प्रत्ययलक्षणं न भवति "When an affix has been elided by लुक् or लुप्, the _pratyaya_-_lakshana_ rule will not apply, when the object of it is to give the designation of _Pada_ to the second member of a compound, with the exception of the rule applying to the beginning of a _Pada_". Thus in परमदण्डिन् the word दण्डिन् is not treated as a पद, because the rule to be applied is to the end here. But the second member of a compound is treated like a _pada_, when a rule is to be applied to the beginning of a _Pada_. Thus in दधिसेचौ, the second member सेच् is considered as a _Pada_ for the purposes of the rule सात् पदाद्योः (VIII. 3. 111), and the स is not changed to ष ॥ This view proceeds upon the supposition that the word पदात् governs this _sutra_. But the _anuvritti_ of पदात् ceased with (VIII. I. 27), as we stated before. How are we then to get out of this difficulty? Are we to make the above _vartika_ necessary? No: because the _anuvritti_ of पदे from (VIII. 3. 21) runs into this _sutra_. So that the _sutra_ means अजादौ पदे ङमुड् भवति ॥ "The augment ङमुट् is added to a vowel with which a _Pada_ commences". Not therefore to the case-affix आ in दण्डिना ॥
