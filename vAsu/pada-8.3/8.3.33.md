sutra: मय उञो वो वा
vRtti: मय उत्तरस्य उञो वा वकारादेशो भवति अचि परतः ॥

Thus शमु अस्तु वेदिः or शम्वस्तु वेदिः, तद् उ अस्य रेतः or तद्वस्य रेतः, किम् उ आवपनम् or किम्वावपनम् ॥ The उ is a _Pragrihya_ by (1.1.14), and therefore would have remained unchanged, this ordains व् optionally. This व being considered _asiddha_, the म् is not changed to _anusvara_ in किम्वावपनम्, शम्वस्तु &c, by (8.3.23).

When this उ is followed by इति, and preceded by a मय् consonant, then by (1.1.17), it is optionally प्रगृह्य, and it may be replaced by ऊँ ॥ When it is not a _pragrihya_, then it is changed to व् by यणादेश (6.1.77), or to व् by the present _sutra_. In the case of यणादेश व्, there is _anusvara_ by (8.3.23), as किंविति ॥ When it is a _Pragrihya_, then it is changed to व् by the present _sutra_ as किम्विति or किमु इति ॥ So also with ऊँ substitute, where the व्ँ will be nasal : as किम्विँति, or ऊँ will remain unchanged, as किम् ऊँ इति ॥ Thus we have five forms with इति ॥
