sutra: कुप्वोᳵकᳶपौ च
vRtti: कवर्गपवर्गयोः परतो विसर्जनीयस्य यथासंख्यᳵकᳶप इत्यतावादेशौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: ᳵक and ᳶप are optionally substituted for the _visarga_, when followed by a hard guttural or a hard labial.

Thus वृक्षᳵकरोति or वृक्षः करोति, वृक्षᳵखनति or वृक्षः खनति, वृक्षᳶपचति or वृक्षः पचति, वृक्षᳶफलति or वृक्षः फलति ॥ The क and  प in ᳵक and ᳶप are for the sake of pronunciation only. The substitutes are the _Jihvamuliya_ and the _Upadhmaniya_ : two lost sibilants belonging to the class of क and प respectively.

When the rule (VIII.3.34). does not apply, then this _sutra_ will apply; and will debar that. But (VIII.3.35). will not be debarred. As वासः क्षौमम्, अद्भिः त्सातम् ॥ There is no _vipratishedha_ between (VIII.3.35). and (VIII.3.37), because of the _asiddhahood_ of one with regard to the other. (VIII. 2. I). In fact, every rule in these three chapters stands by itself, and ignores the existence of the subsequent rule. Hence (VIII.3.35) would not have been debarred by (VIII.3.37).

To get this, some divide this _sutra_ into two :- (1) कुप्वोः "The _visarga_ is the substitute of _visarga_ before a guttural or labial which is followed by a sibilant." (2) ᳵक ᳶपौच The _jihvamuliya_ and _upadhmaniya_ are substitutes of a _visarga_ before a guttural and a labial in every other case."
