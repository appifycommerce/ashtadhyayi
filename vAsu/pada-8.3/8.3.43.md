sutra: द्विस्त्त्रिश्चतुरिति कृत्वोर्थे
vRtti: ष इति संबद्ध्यते । द्विस् त्रिस् चतुर् इत्येतेषां कृत्वोर्थे वर्त्तमानानां विसर्जनीयस्य षकार आदेशो भवति अन्यतरस्यां कुप्वोः परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: ष् is optionally the substitute of the _visargas_ of द्विस्, त्रिस् and चतुर् when they are used as Numeral adverbs, (before a hard guttural and labial).

---
The affix सुच् (स्) is added to the three words _dvi_, _tri_ and _chatur_ in the sense of _krtvasuch_ by (V.4.18).

As द्विः करोति or द्विष्करोति, त्रिः करोति or त्रिष्करोति, चतुः करोति or चतुष्करोति, द्विः पचति or द्विष्पचति, त्रिः पचति or त्रिष्पचति, चतुः पचति or चतुष्पचति ॥

Why do we say 'when used in the sense of _kritvasuch_ or Numeral adverbs '? Observe चतुष्कपालम्, चतुष्कण्टकम्, where ष is compulsory by (VIII.3.41). चतुर्षु कपालेषु संस्कृतः (IV.2.16) and (IV.1.88). This _sutra_ is an example of _ubhayatra_-_vibhasha_. With regard to चतुर् the _visarga_ is a non-affix _visarga_, and hence (VIII.3.41), would have made ष compulsory, this makes it optional. With regard to द्विस् and त्रिस् the _visarga_ is that of an affix (सुच् or स् (V.4.18)), and hence (VIII.3.41), would not have applied. Thus with regard to चतुर् it is a _Prapta_-_vibhasha_, and with regard to द्विस् and त्रिस् it is an _Aprapta_ _vibhasha_. 

Why have we used the words '_dvis_, _tris_ and _chatur_'? Objector's answer: so that the rule may not apply to पंचकृत्वः करोति, the _visarga_ of _kritvasuch_ (V.4.17) is not changed to ष् ॥

The _anuvritti_ of उ and इ is understood here from (VIII.3.41): so that the _visarga_ must be preceded by इ and उ for the application of this rule. In पञ्चकृत्वः the _visarga_ is preceded by अ, and so there is no applicability of this rule.

In fact, by reading the _anuvritti_ of इदुदुपधा into this _sutra_, and qualifying the _visarga_ by the further epithet of 'belonging to a word that has the sense of _kritvasuch_'; we may dispense with the words द्विस्त्रिश्चतुरिति from the _sutra_. The simple _sutra_ कृत्वोर्थे would have been enough. For there are no other Numerals that have a penultimate इ or उ, except these three. The chief objection to this view is, that in चतुर् the _visarga_ is not the affix सुच्, but a portion of the word (See (V.4.18)): so the rule would not apply to _chatur_, if this word were not expressly mentioned.

The various objections and their solutions are given in the following verses.

कृत्वसुजर्थे षत्वं ब्रवीति कस्माच्चचतुष्कपाले मा
षत्वं विभाषया भूम्ननु सिद्धं तत्र पूर्वेण ॥
सिद्धे ह्ययं विधत्ते चतुरः षत्वं यदापि कृत्वोर्थे ॥
लुप्ते कृत्वोर्थीये रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि ॥
एवं सति त्विदानीं द्वित्त्रिश्चतुरित्यनेन किं कार्यम् ॥
अन्यो हि नेदुदुपधः कृत्वोर्थः कश्चिदप्यस्ति ॥
अक्रियमाणे ग्रहणे विसर्जनीयस्तदा विशेष्येत ॥
चतुरो न सिध्यति तथा रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि ॥
तस्मिंस्तु क्रियमाणे युक्तं चतुरो विशेषणं भवति ॥
प्रकृतं पदं तदन्तं तस्यापि विशेषणं न्याय्यम् ॥

_Karika_:- कृत्वसुजर्थे षत्वं ब्रवीति कस्मात्? Why does the author teach षत्व when these words have the sense of Numeral-adverbs? In other words, why the word कृत्वोर्थे is used at all in the _sutra_? There is no necessity of using it at all, because द्विस्, त्रिस् are clearly adverbs as they are formed by the affix सुच् (V.4.18) and चतुर् being read in their company will also denote the adverb _chatur_, in which सुच् has been elided (V.4.18). So that all these three words are सुच्-formed, and all सुच्-formed words have the sense of _Krtvasuch_. One answer to this is that the rule of साहचर्य does not always hold good, as in दीधीवेवीटाम् (I.1.6), the words दीधी and वेवी are verbs, while इट् is an augment. Though therefore द्विस् and त्रिस् are _krtvortha_ words, yet चतुर् need not be so: and may be a simple Numeral. Answer: चतुष्कपाले मा षत्वं विभाषया भूत् ॥ The word कृत्वोर्थे is employed to indicate that there should be no optional षत्व in चतुष्कपालं ॥ The षत्व here is compulsory by (VIII.3.41). Question: ननु सिद्धं तत्र पूर्वेण ॥ Well this would be valid by the previous _sutra_ (VIII.3.41). That is, let in चतुष्कपाल also there be optional षत्व, as चतुःकपाल and चतुष्कपाल ॥ Now rule (VIII.3.41) will apply to चतुःकपाल and will change this _visarga_ to ष, so that with regard to चतुष्कपाल, we shall have always ष ॥ Answer:- सिद्धे ह्ययं विधत्ते चतुरः षत्वं यदापि कृत्वोर्थे, लुप्ते कृत्वोर्थीये रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि । If (VIII.3.41) be considered as applying here (_siddha_), then when the affix सुच् is elided after चतुर्, and the र is changed to _visarga_, then the adverb चतुः also ends with a non-affix _visarga_, and will come under the compulsory षत्व rule of (VIII.3.41); for though we may have optionally two forms as चतुः करोति and चतुष्करोति, by the present _sutra_, yet in the former the _visarga_ would be changed to ष by (VIII.3.41). Hence the necessity of employing the word कृत्वोर्थे ॥ Question: But we say that the र् in the adverb चतुर् is that of सुच्, thus चतुर् + स् = चतुर् + र् (VIII.2.66) = चतु + र् (the first र् is elided by (VIII.3.14)) = चतुर्; and that this र् when changed to _visarga_, will be an affix-_visarga_ and so (VIII.3.41) will not apply to the adverb चतुर् ॥ Answer:- No. For उ would require to be lengthened by (VI.3.111). and the form would be चतूर् ॥

एवं सति त्विदानीं द्विस्त्रिश्चतुरित्यनेन किं कार्यम् ॥ If this be so, then what is the purpose served by using the words द्विस् त्रिश्चतुरिति in the aphorism? The simple _sutra_ कृत्वोऽर्थे would have been enough. Because (अन्योहि नेदुदुपधः कुत्वोर्थः कश्चिदप्यस्ति) there are no other numeral adverbs than these three which have a penultimate इ or उ ॥

अक्रियमाणे ग्रहणे विसर्जनीयस्तदा विशेष्येत । If we do not use the words _dvis_, _tris_, _chaturiti_ in the _sutra_, then the word_ krtvorthe_ would qualify the word _visarga_, and the _sutra_ would mean " the _visarga_ of an affix which has the sense of _kritvasuch_ is changed optionally to ष" ॥ The result of this will be that (चतुरा न सिध्यति तथारेफस्य विसर्जनीयोहि) it will not apply to चतुः where the _visarga_ is that of र् and not of the affix सुच् ॥

Therefore by using _dvis_ &c, the word कृत्वोर्थे would qualify चतुर् (तस्मिन् तु क्रियमाणे युक्तं चतुरो विशेषणं भवति) ॥

Answer:- प्रकृतं पदं तदन्तं तस्यापि, विशेषणं नाय्यम् ॥ Though we may not use _dvis_ &c, the word _krtvortha_ will not qualify _visarga_, but will qualify the word पद whose context runs here; and the rule of तदन्त will apply; so that the _sutra_ कृत्वोऽर्थे will mean, पदस्य कृत्वोर्थे वर्त्तमानस्य यो विसर्जनीयः, तस्य सकारः षकारो व ॥ "The _visarga_ of that word which is employed in the sense of a Numeral adverb, is optionally changed to स् or ष् before a guttural or a labial, provided that such _visarga_ is preceded by इ or उ".

The above is the opinion of _Patanjali_, who considers the words _dvis_ &c, as redundant. The _Kasika_ however controverts this opinion. According to him, if these words were not used in the _sutra_, then the mere _sutra_ कृत्वोऽर्थे would be insufficient for the _visarga_ of चतुः though used as an adverb, the षत्व will be compulsory by (VIII.3.41); for the present _sutra_ will be considered as _asiddha_ or non-existent for the purposes of (VIII.3.41), (See (VIII.2.1)). But this however may be answered by saying that the rule of पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् applies in these chapters, with this modification, one subject-matter is considered as _asiddha_ with regard to another subject-matter gone before; but one aphorism is not considered _asiddha_ with regard to a previous aphorism, when belonging to the same subject matter. (प्रकरणे प्रकरणमसिद्धं न योगे योगः) ॥ Therefore the present _sutra_ (VIII.3.43), would not be considered _asiddha_ with regard to (VIII.3.41). Or the present _sutra_ may be considered as an _apavada_ to (VIII.3.41): and an _apavada_ is never _asiddha_ with regard to an _utsarga_.
