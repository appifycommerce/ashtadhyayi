sutra: समः सुटि
vRtti: सम इत्येतस्य रुर्भवति सुटि परतः संहितायां विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: रु is substituted for the म् of सम् (and thereby अँ or अं is substituted for अ) when the augment स् follows, in a _samhita_.

---
The augment सुट् is added by (6.1.137) &c. Thus सँस्स्कर्त्ता or संस्स्कर्त्ता, सँस्स्कर्तुम् or संस्स्कर्तुम्, सँस्स्कर्त्तव्यम् or संस्स्कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ The word is thus evolved: सम् + स् + कर्ता = सर् + स् + कर्ता (8.3.5). Here rule (8.3.15) appears and requires to be changed to _visarjaniya_. This _visarga_ may optionally be retained unchanged by (8.3.36). This, however, is not done in the present instance : but the _visarga_ is always and necessarily changed to स् by (8.3.34). In fact, the option of (8.3.36) is a determinate option (_vyavasthita_ _vibhasha_) and does not apply to the present case.

Or even this _sutra_ may be so read as to teach the स् substitution as well. Thus, the _sutra_ is समः स्सुटि with two स्, and the _sutra_ will mean, "रु is substituted for the म् of सम् before सुट्, and this रु is always changed to स्" ॥

Why do we say "for the म् of सम्"? Observe उपस्कर्त्ता ॥ Why do we say "before सुट्"? Observe संकृति ॥

Vart:- For the finals of सम्, पुम् and कान् there is always substituted स ॥ There would arise anomalies, if रु be substituted. Thus संस्कर्त्ता, पुंस्स्कामा, कांस्स्कान् ॥ In fact, according to this _vartika_, रु is never substituted for सम् (8.3.5), पुम् (8.3.6) and कान् (8.3.12).

Vart:- समो वा लोपमेके ॥ Some would have the elision of the स् after सम् ॥ This _Vartika_ is not given in the _Kasika_, but the _Padamanjari_ gives it, and so also the _Mahabhashya_.

According to _Bhattoji_ _Dikshita_ there will be 108 forms of this word संस्कर्त्ता ॥ Thus सँस्कर्त्ता and संस्कर्त्ता with the elision of स् ॥ Then with two स्, as सँस्स्कर्त्ता or संस्स्कर्ता ॥ Then we apply (8.4.47) to this latter, and have three स, as सँस्स्स्कर्ता or संस्स्स्कर्ता ॥ The _anusvara_ is considered to be a vowel (अच्) for this purpose. From the three nasal forms सँस्कर्ता, सँस्स्कर्ता and सँस्स्स्कर्ता, we get three more by doubling the क् by the _vartika_ : शरः खयः ॥ The three forms having _anusvara_, will also double their _anusvara_ in addition to क् doubling. Thus we have 12 forms in _anusvara_: and six in nasal, altogether 18 forms. Then the त will be doubled and trebled : and thus with one त, two त and three त, we have 3 x 18 = 54 forms. This will be doubled (2 x 54 = 108) when अण् is nasalised.
