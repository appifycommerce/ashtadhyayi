vRtti: अपदान्तस्येति मूर्द्धन्य इति चैतदधिकृतं वेदितव्यम् । आपादपरिसमाप्तेः ॥
vRtti_eng: "Upto the end of the _Pada_, is throughout to be supplied the following: 'A cerebral letter is substituted always in the room of ------, when this letter does not stand at the end of a word'."

Here ceases the _Padadhikara_ which commenced with (VIII. I. 16). The two words अपदान्तस्य 'not final in a _pada_', and मूर्द्धन्यः 'cerebral' exert a governing influence on all _sutras_ upto the end of this chapter. Thus (VIII. 3. 59), teaches "of an affix and a substitute". The whole of the present _sutra_ should be read there to complete the sense : i.e. "a cerebral sound is substituted always in the room of the स of an affix and of the स which is a substitute, when it does not stand at the end of a word". Thus सिषेव, सुष्वाप, अग्निषु, वायुषु ॥

Why do we say not 'final'? See अग्निस्तत्र, वायुस्तत्र ॥ Though the _anuvritti_ of ष was understood here, yet the employment of the word 'cerebral' is for the sake of ढ; as अकृढ्वम्, चकृढ्वे (VIII. 3. 78).
