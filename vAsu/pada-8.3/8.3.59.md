sutra: आदेशप्रत्यययोः
vRtti: आदेशो यः सकारः प्रत्ययस्य च यः सकार इण्कोरुत्तरस्तस्य मूर्द्धन्यो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: ष् is substituted for that स् which is a substitute (of the ष् of a root in _Dhatupatha_ by (VI. 1. 64)), or which is (the portion of) an affix, under the above mentioned conditions (VIII. 3. 57), (VIII. 3. 58), of being preceded by an इण् vowel or a guttural.

The word cerebral is understood here from (VIII.3.55), as well as स ॥ The _sutra_ _adesa_-_pratyayoh_ is in the Genitive case. The force of the Genitive however is different in the word _adesa_, from what it is in _pratyaya_. In the first it is _samanadhikarana_-_shashthi_, in the latter _avayava_-yogashashthi_. That is that स् which is an _adesa_, and that स् which belongs to an affix. If we took it as _avayavayoga_ _shashthi_ in both places, then the _sutra_ would mean "of that स् which is a portion of a substitute, or of an affix," and there would arise the following anomaly. In doubling a word by (VIII.1.1), one view is that two are substituted in the room of one (See (VIII.1.1)). Thus बिसंबिसं, मुसलंमुसलं ॥ Here the स् in these words, is a portion of a substitute, and would be changed to ष्, if we translate the _sutra_ as above.

If we take the other view, and translate the _sutra_ as "of that स् which is a substitute or an affix", we land on the following anomaly. We must have forms like करिस्यति and हरिस्यति, and not the correct forms करिष्यति, हरिष्यति; for here स is not an affix, but a portion of an affix. In fact, with regard to affixes, the _sutra_ would be confined to those affixes only which consist of a single स्, such as सिप् in the Vedic subjunctive लेट् ॥ That this is the proper interpretation of the _sutra_ is indicated by the _sutra_ (VIII.3.60), (the next aphorism). The substitute घस् is taken in this _sutra_. If therefore, the force of Genitive in आदेशस्य was = आदेशस्य यः सकारः and not = आदेशः यः सकारः, then there would have been no necessity of including the substitute घस् in the _sutra_, for then the present _sutra_ would have covered the case of घस् also. Similarly, if the force of the Genitive in प्रत्ययस्य was = प्रत्ययः यः सकारः, and not = प्रत्ययस्यः यः सकारः; then there would have been no necessity of excluding the affix सात् (V.4.52) from the operation of the present rule by (VIII.3.111), because it is not an affix consisting of a single letter स् ॥

Having surmised this, we shall now give illustrations. First of that स् which is a substitute. It can only be the स् which replaces the ष् of a root in _Dhatupatha_. Thus सिषेव, सुष्वाप ॥ Of an affix, we have अग्निषु, वायुषु, कर्तृषु, हर्तृषु; वक्षत् in इन्द्रो मा वक्षत्; and यक्षत् in स देवान् यक्षत् ॥

In the case of वक्षत् and यक्षत्, the स् is not the portion of an affix, but the whole affix itself: the present _sutra_ should therefore not apply to this स् ॥

Answer:- Here we apply the maxim व्यपदेशिवद् एकस्मिन् ॥

These words (वक्षत् and यक्षत्) are from the roots वच् and यज्, in लेट् with तिप्, the इ is elided by (III.4.97), the augment अट् (III.4.94), the affix सिप् by (III.1.34); the च् of वच् is changed to a guttural, and the ज् of यज् to ष् and then to a guttural.

The _Unadi_ word अक्षरं (अश् + सर् _Unadi_ III. 70) complies with this rule, but not so the word कूसरं and धूसरं (_Unadi_ III. 73) formed with the same affix सर ॥
