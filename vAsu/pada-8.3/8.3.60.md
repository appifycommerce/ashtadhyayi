sutra: शासिवसिघसीनांच
vRtti: शासि वसि घसि इत्येतेषां च इण्कोरुत्तरस्य सकारस्य मूर्द्धन्यो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: ष् is substituted for the स् of शास्, वस् and घस् when it is preceded by an इण् vowel or a guttural.

Thus अन्वशिषत्, अन्वशिषताम्, अन्वशिषन्, the Aorist of शास्; the च्लि is replaced by अङ् (3.1.56), and the आ changed to इ by (6.4.34). So also शिष्टः, शिष्टवान् ॥ From वस् we have उषितः, उषितवान्, उषित्वा ॥ The _Samprasarana_ takes place by (6.1.15) as it belongs to _yajadi_ class. From घस् we have जक्षतुः, जक्षुः in the Perfect. घस् is the substitute of अद् (2.4.40), the penultimate अ is elided by (6.4.98). So also अक्षन् in अक्षन्नमीमदन्त पितरः (_Rig_. 1.82.2). This is the Aorist form of अद्, the घस् is substituted for अद् (2.4.37) the Aorist sign is elided by (2.4.80).

This _sutra_ is made to cover cases not governed by the last _sutra_, namely, where the स् is not an _adesa_. Though the स् in घस् is the स् of a substitute, yet it is not governed by the preceding aphorism, because the word आदेशस्य there means 'the स् which is a substitute'. Here स् is not a substitute, but a portion of a substitute. The non-substitute घस् is not to be taken here : as it seldom occurs.

The word इण्कोः is understood here also. Therefore the rule would not apply to शास्ति, वसति and जघास ॥
