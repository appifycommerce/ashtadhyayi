sutra: स्थादिष्वभ्यासेन चाभ्यासस्य
vRtti: प्राक् सितादिति वर्त्तते ॥ उपसर्गात्सुनोतीत्यत्र स्थासेनयसेधेति स्थादयस्तेषु स्थादिषु प्राक् सितसंशब्दनाद् अभ्यासेन व्यवाये मूर्द्धन्यो भवत्यभ्याससकारस्य च भवतीत्येवं वेदितव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: "In स्था &c upto सित् exclusive (VIII. 3. 65) to (VIII. 3. 70), this ष substitution takes place then also, when the reduplicate intervenes, and the स of the reduplicate is also changed to ष ॥"

The words प्राक् सितात् are understood here also. The स्यादि roots are, स्था, सेनय &c in (VIII. 3. 65) and ending with सेव् in (VIII. 3. 70). The _sutra_ consists of two sentences : (1) The षत्व takes place in स्था &c. even when a reduplicate intervenes; (2) The स of the reduplicates of स्था &c. is changed to ष ॥ The first is a _vidhi_ rule, and the second is a _niyama_ rule.

Thus परितष्ठौ where the _abhyasa_ त intervenes. This applies even to roots other than those which have been taught with a ष in the _Dhatupatha_. As अभिषिषेणयिषति, परिषिषेणयिषति (सेनया अभियातुमिच्छन्ति). This applies moreover to reduplicates which end in अ, as अभितष्ठौ; here the स् would not have been changed to ष (by (VIII. 3. 59)) as it is not preceded by इ or उ ॥ Another raison d'etre of this _sutra_ is that it prohibits षण् (VIII. 3. 61). As अभिषिषिक्षति, परिषिषिक्षति ॥

The word अभ्यासस्य is for the sake of _niyama_, as we have said above. स of स्था &c. and of no other roots is changed to ष ॥ As अभिसुसूषति from षू प्रेरणे with सन्, the augment is debarred by (VII. 2. 12): the root स् is unchanged by the _niyama_ prohibition of (VIII. 3. 61); the reduplicate स् remains unchanged by the restriction of the present _sutra_.
