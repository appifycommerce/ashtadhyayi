sutra: सदिरप्रेतः
vRtti: सदेः सकारस्य उपसर्गस्यान्निमित्तादप्रेतरुत्तरस्य मूर्द्धन्य आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The स of सद् is changed to ष after an _Upasarga_ having an इ or उ, but not after प्रति ॥

---
The word सदिः is in the first case, but has the force of genitive. Thus निषीदति, विषीदति, न्यषीदत्, व्यषीदत् ॥ निषसाद, विषसाद ॥ The second स remains unchanged in the Perfect by (8.3.118).

Why do we say 'but not after प्रति'? Observe प्रतिसीदति ॥ Prof. Bohtlingk points out that the _sutra_ is सदेरप्रतेः as given by _Sayanacharya_ in his commentary on _Rig_ _Veda_ VI. 13. I. _Panini_, however, often uses the first case with the force of the Genitive, as in (8.3.80).
