sutra: परिस्कन्दः प्राच्यभरतेषु
vRtti: परिस्कन्द इति मूर्द्धन्याभावो निपात्यते प्राच्यभरतेषु प्रयोगविषयेषु ॥
vRtti_eng: "The word परिस्कन्द is used without the cerebral change in the country of Eastern _Bharata_."

This is an anomaly. The ष required by the last _sutra_ is prohibited. The other form is परिष्कन्दः ॥ The word परिस्कन्द is formed by the affix अच् or it is a _Nishtha_, the त being elided. The word भरत qualifies the word प्राच्य ॥

Prof. Bohtlingk translates it "परिस्कन्द is seen in the usage of the Eastern People and the _Bharata_". He bases his construction on the _sutras_ (II. 4. 66), and (IV. 2. 113), where प्राच्यभरतेषु means "the Eastern People and _Bharata_".
