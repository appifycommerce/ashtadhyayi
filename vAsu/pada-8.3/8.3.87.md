sutra: उपसर्गप्रादुर्भ्यामस्तिर्यच्परः
vRtti: उपसर्गस्थान्निमित्तात्प्रादुस्शब्दाच्चोत्तरस्य यकारपरस्याच्परस्य चास्तिसकारस्य मूर्द्धन्यो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The स् of the verb अस् is changed to ष्, when it is followed by a vowel or य् and is preceded by प्रादुः, or an _upasarga_ having इ or उ in it."
---
The word यच् परः means 'followed by य् or अच्' ॥ The word प्रादुः is an Indeclinable, meaning 'evidently'.

Thus अभिषन्ति, निषन्ति, विषन्ति, प्रादुःषन्ति; अभिष्यात्, निष्यात्, विष्यात्, प्रादुःष्यात् ॥

Why do we say "when preceded by an _Upasarga_ having an इ or उ?" Observe दधिस्यात्, मधुस्यात् ॥ Why do we say 'of the verb अस्'? Observe अनुसृतम्, विसृतम् ॥

Question:- How is there any occasion for the application of the rule here? The context here relates to स, and the word "_upasarga_" qualifies that स, but here the _upasarga_ is not applied to स् but to the whole verb सृ, therefore this is no counter-example. In fact, what is the necessity of using the word अस् at all in the _sutra_: for even without it, the word '_upasarga_' would qualify that verb which consists of स् only, and such a verb is अस्, with its अ elided and no other verb? Nor is the employment of अस् necessary for प्रादुः, for it comes only in connection with the verbs कृ, भू and अस् ॥

Answer:- All that you urge, is true, yet the following counter-example should be given, as अनुसू, the son of _Anusu_ will be आनुसेयः with ढक् as it belongs to _Subhradi_ class. Thus अनुसू + ढक् = आनुसू + एय = आनुस् + एय ॥ Here the ऊ is elided by (VI. 4. 147). Now when ऊ is elided, the स् is the only verb-element that remains, अनु is _upasarga_, and एय is affix; so that had अस् not been taken in the _sutra_, the rule would apply to this स् also.

Why do we say "when it is followed by a vowel or य्"? Observe निस्तः, विस्तः, प्रादुस्तः ॥
