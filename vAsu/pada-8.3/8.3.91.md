sutra: कपिष्ठलो गोत्रे
vRtti: कपिष्ठल इति निपात्यते गोत्रविषये ॥
vRtti_eng: The word कपिष्ठल is irregularly formed denoting the founder of a _gotra_ of that name.

Thus the son of _Kapishthala_ will be कापिष्ठलिः ॥ The word "_ gotra_" here does not mean the grammatical "_gotra_," but the popular term '_ gotra_' denoting 'clans,' as described in the list of _pravaras_. Why do we say "when denoting the founder of a _ gotra_"? Observe कपिस्थलम् The land of the monkeys.
