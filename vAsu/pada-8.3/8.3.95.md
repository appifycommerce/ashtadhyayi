sutra: गवियुधिभ्यां स्थिरः
vRtti: गवियुधिभ्यामुत्तरस्य स्थिरसकारस्य मूर्धन्यादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The स् of स्थिरः is changed to ष् after the words गवि and युधि ॥"
---
Thus गविष्ठिर, युधिष्ठिर ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. I. 44). and the 7th case affix is not elided by (VI. 3. 9). though the word गो does not end in a consonant, yet it retains its Locative ending by virtue of this _sutra_.
