sutra: रषाभ्यां नो णः समानपदे
vRtti: रेफषकाराभ्यामुत्तरस्य नकारस्य णकारादेशो भवति, समानपदस्थौ चेन्निमित्तनिमित्तिनौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: After र् and ष्, the ण् is the substitute of न्, when they occur as component letters of the same word.

---
These letters must be parts of the same _pada_ or word, one being the 'occasion' for the application of the rule as regards the other. As आस्तीर्णम्, विस्तीर्णम्, अवगूर्णम् ॥ So also after ष; as कृष्णाति, पुष्णाति, मुष्णाति ॥

The letter ष् is included in this aphorism for the sake of subsequent _sutras_ : for न् will be changed into ण् when preceded by ष् by rule (8.4.41) of this Chapter, as well.

Why do we say "when occurring in the same word?" Observe अग्निर्नयति, वायुर्नयति ॥

Vart:- So also after the letters ऋ ॥ As तिसृणाम्, चतसृणाम्, मातॄणाम्, पितॄणाम् ॥
This _vartika_ may well be dispensed with: because the र in the _sutra_ is the common sound र which we perceive both in र and ऋ; and so the र will denote both the vowel ऋ and the consonant र. See contra. (8.2.42). Objection:- But if even this be so, the letter ऋ has three parts, its first part is a vowel, in the middle is the र् sound of a quarter _matra_, and a vowel sound at the end. This vowel-sound will intervene between the र-sound and the subsequent न, and will prevent the application of the _sutra_, hence the _vartika_ is valid ?

Answer:- This vowel-sound will be no intervention, because it will be included in the exception अट् of the next _sutra_. Objection:- The vowel-sound at the end of ऋ is not a full vowel of one _matra_, but is of half-_matra_, being only a fragment of ऋ, and hence is not included in the _pratyahara_ अट्, it has no separate स्थान or प्रयत्न or homogeneity with any vowel. Hence this vowel-sound will prevent the application of this rule. Answer:- The ण change, however, does take place in spite of such intervention of a fragment of a letter, as we know from the _jnapaka_ of (8.4.39). In the _kshubhnadi_ list there we find नृनमन as an exception, implying that न is generally changed to ण after such a fragmentary interposition. Or we may take नृनमन as a _jnapaka_, that after the letter ऋ also the ण change takes place.
