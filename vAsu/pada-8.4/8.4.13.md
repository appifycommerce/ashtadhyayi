sutra: कुमति च
vRtti: कवर्गवति चोत्तरपदे प्रातिपदिकान्तनुम्विभक्तिषु पूर्वपदस्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्य नकारस्य णकारदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "In a compound, the second member of which contains a guttural, there is ण in the room of न, that follows anything which standing in the prior member is qualified to cause the change, provided the न be at the end of a _pratipadika_, or be the augment नुम्, or occur in a _vibhakti_."

If the second part of a compound contains a letter of the class क्, the change is obligatory, even though the second part be not monosyllabic. As वस्त्रयुगिणौ, वस्त्रयुगिणः, स्वर्गकामिणौ, वृषगामिणौ ॥ नुम् :- वस्त्रयुगाणि, खरयुगाणि ॥ विभक्ति :- वस्त्रयुगेण, खरयुगेण ॥

The word वस्त्रयुगिणौ is a compound of वस्त्र with युगिन् (the affix इनिis added first to युग and then the word so formed is compounded with _vastra_). Thus the न् becomes प्रातिपदिकान्त i.e. it becomes the final of a Nominal-stem, which stands as a second member in a compound.
