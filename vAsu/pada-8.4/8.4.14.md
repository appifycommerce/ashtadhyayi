sutra: उपसर्गादसमासेऽपि णोपदेशस्य
vRtti: ण उपदेशे यस्यासौ णोपदेशः । णोपदेशस्य धातोर्यो नकारः तस्य उपसर्गस्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्य णकारादेशो भवति असमासेपि समासेपि ॥
vRtti_eng: "Of a root which has ण in its original enunciation, when it comes after a cause of such change standing in an _upasarga_, even though the word be not a _samasa_, the न is changed into ण ॥"
---
The word णोपदेश means a root which is enunciated in the _Dhatupatha_ with an initial ण ॥ Thus प्रणमति 'he bows'. परिणमति, प्रणायकः 'a leader' परिणायकः &c.

Why do we say "after an _Upasarga_"? Observe प्रनायकः = प्रगता नायका अस्माद् देशात् 'a country without a leader'. Here the word प्र is not an _upasarga_, but a mere _nipata_. See (I. 4. 57), (I. 4. 58) and (I. 4. 59). In fact, प्र is _upasarga_ here with regard to गत understood, and not with regard to नी ॥

Why do we say "even when it is not a compound?" Because by context, the _anuvritti_ of the word पूर्वपद, which is current throughout this subdivision, would have been understood in this _sutra_ also, and the rule would have applied to _samasas_ only, for there only we have _purvapada_. By using the word असमासे it is shown that the _adhikara_ of _purvapada_ ceases, and the rule applies to non-compounds also where there is no पूर्वपद ॥

Why do we say "having ण in _Upadesa_"? Observe प्रनर्दति, प्रनर्दितुम्, प्रनर्दकः ॥ For the root नर्द is recited in _Dhatupatha_ with न ॥ There are eight such roots नर्द्, नाट्, नाथ्, नाध्, नन्द्, नक्क्, नॄ, नृत् ॥ See (VI. 1. 65).
