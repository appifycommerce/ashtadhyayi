Thus प्रहिणोति, प्रहिणुतः, प्रमीणाति, प्रमीणीतः ॥ The root हि belongs to _Svadi_ class of verbs and takes the _vikarana_ नु technically श्नु; and the root मी belongs to _Kryadi_ class which takes the _vikarana_ श्ना ॥ In the _sutra_ the verbs are shown with the _vikaranas_ affixed. Under certain circumstances the forms of the _vikarana_ is changed from नु to नो and ना to नी, but the rule still applies, because the substitute of an अच् or vowel is like the principal. See (l. I. 57).
