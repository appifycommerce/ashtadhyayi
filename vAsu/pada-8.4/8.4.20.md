sutra: अन्तः
vRtti: उपसर्गस्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्यानितिनकारस्य पदान्ते वर्तमानस्य णकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The न of अन् is changed into ण, when it is preceded by an _upasarga_ competent to produce the change, provided it occurs at the end of a _pada_.

As हे प्राण् ! हे पराण् ! This rule is an exception to (VIII.4.37) sub, by which final न् in a _pada_ is not changed into ण ॥ The word अन्तः in the _sutra_ is to be understood to be equivalent to पदान्तः, and the rule applies when the word is in the vocative case.

According to some अन्तः is taken to be a part of the last _sutra_, and has the meaning of 'proximity'. That is the न is changed to ण, if the र is not separated from the न् by more than one letter. Therefore there is no change in परि + अनिति = पर्यनिति ॥ In this view, another अन्त should be taken for the sake of final न्, in हे प्राण् ॥

According to others the form पर्यणिति is valid, and they do not connect अन्तः with the last _sutra_.

The word प्राण् is a क्विप् formed word, and the न् final is not elided in the Vocative Singular because of the prohibition of (VIII.2.8); in every other place, when the न् is _padanta_, it would be dropped; and therefore the illustration is given with Vocative singular, which alone satisfies the requirements of this _sutra_.
