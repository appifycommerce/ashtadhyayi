sutra: उभौ साभ्यासस्य
vRtti: साभ्यासस्यानितेरुपसर्गस्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्योभयोर्नकारयोर्णकार आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "Both the न s are changed into ण in the reduplicated forms of the verb अन्, when preceded by an _upasarga_ competent to cause the change."

Thus in the Desiderative प्राणिणिषति and Aorist of the Causative प्राणिणत्, and so also पराणिणिषति and पराणिणत् ॥

If the maxim पूर्वत्रासिद्धीयमद्विर्वचने be applied here; then we have the following dilemma in, प्रानि + स + ति ॥ Here the affix सन् requires reduplication, and the present _sutra_ requires ण change of न ॥ The णत्व being _asiddha_, the reduplication being made first, we have प्राणिनि + स + ति, and then the reduplicate ण intervenes between the cause प्र and the root- न् of नि, and so this न would not be changed to ण ॥ If however the above maxim be applied, we first apply the णत्व rule, as प्राणि + स + ति, and then reduplicate णि; and we get the form प्राणिणिषति even without this _sutra_.

If we could get this form by the application of the above maxim, where is the necessity of the present _sutra_? The _sutra_ is necessary in order to indicate that the above maxim is _anitya_ or not of universal application. And because it is _anitya_, that the form औजढत् is evolved by reduplicating हत् (See (VIII. 2. 1)).
