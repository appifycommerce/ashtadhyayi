sutra: छन्दस्यृदवग्रहात्
vRtti: ऋकारान्तादवग्रहात्पूर्वपदादुत्तरस्य णकारादेशो भवति छन्दसि विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: "In the _Chhandas_, न of a second term is changed into ण, when the prior term ends with a short ऋ even when there is an _avagraha_ or hiatus between the two terms."

In the _Veda_, न् becomes ण्, after a ऋ, after which in _Padapatha_, the word appertaining to it is divided. Thus in _Pada_-_patha_ the words नृमणाः &c, are separated, and are read as नृ, मणाः ॥ The word अवगृह्यते = विच्छिद्य पठ्यते, as in _Pada_-_patha_. ऋदवग्रहात् means 'after a short ऋ which is an _avagraha_'. The ऋ here, of course, means 'a word ending in ऋ', because ऋ alone cannot be a _purvapada_. The णत्व only took place during _sanhita_, and in _Pada_ reading this ण would not have remained, hence this _sutra_.

Why have we used the word _avagraha_ in the _sutra_? Because we have already said that the word _sanhita_ governs all _sutras_ of this chapter. So the न is changed to ण in the _Sanhita_ state in these; and the ण is retained, when in the state of _avagraha_. The word _avagraha_ in the _sutra_ indicates the scope of the rule. The न is changed to ण after that ऋ only, which is capable of _avagraha_, namely that ऋ which stands at the end of a word (_pada_), and not that which is in the body of a word. Thus in नृमणाः, पितृयाणम्, the ऋ is capable of _avagraha_, as it is at the end of a word नृ or पितृ; but when it is not at the end of a word, it can never become _avagraha_, and will not produce the ण change.

The word पूर्वपदात् is understood here. The word अवग्रह means a hiatus or separation. Thus पितृ याणम्, नृ मणाः ॥ Here ऋ is अवगृह्य ॥ The change of न into ण is effected ordinarily then, when the terms, one containing the cause, and the other न, are in संहिता or conjunction. For the rules of _Sandhi_ and the rules like these can apply only to words in _sanhita_. The present rule is an exception to it, and here, even when the words are not in संहिता, but there is an actual hiatus between the two, the change still takes place. The word संहिता of (VIII. 2. 108), exerts regulating influence upto the end of the Book.
