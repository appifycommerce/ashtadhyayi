sutra: षात्पदान्तात्
vRtti: षकारात्पदान्तादुत्तरस्य नकारस्य णकारादेशो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After a ष् final in a _Pada_, the न् is not changed to ण् ॥"
---
Thus निष्पानम्, दुष्पानम्; the _visarga_ is changed to ष् here by (VIII. 3. 41). The rule (VIII. 4. 29) is debarred. सर्पिष्पानम् (is a genitive compound contra (II. 2. 14)). So also यजुष्पानम् (II. 1. 32). The ष is in these two by (VIII. 3. 45), and (VIII. 4. 10) is debarred.

Why do we say "षात् after a ष्?" Observe निर्णयः ॥

Why do we say पदान्तात् 'final in a _Pada_'? Observe कुष्णाति, पुष्णाति ॥ The word पदान्त is equivalent to पदे अन्त or Locative _Tatpurusha_; and does not mean final of a _Pada_. Therefore the rule does not apply here. सुसर्पिष्केण (instrumental singular) सुयजुष्केण ॥ Here the क is added by (V. 4. 154). शोभनं सर्पिरस्य = सुसर्पिष्क (a _Bahuvrihi_). The ष is by (VIII. 3. 39). Before the affix क, the word सुसर्पिस् is a _Pada_ (1. 4. 17), and thus स् (ष्) is final of a _Pada_: but it is not final of a preceding member followed by another _Pada_. The rule, in fact, applies to compounds, the ष् being final in the first term.
