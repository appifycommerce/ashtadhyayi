sutra: अभ्यासे चर्च्च
vRtti: अभ्यासे वर्त्तमानानां झलां चरादेशो भवति चकाराज्जश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: "The चर् is also the substitute of झल् letters
occuring in a reduplicate syllable, as well as जश् ॥"
---
In a reduplicate syllable, a sonant non-aspirate (जश्) as well as a surd non aspirate (चर्) is the substitute of a Mute letter. By applying the rule of nearest in place (I. 1. 50), we find that sonant non-aspirate (जश्) is the substitute of all sonants; and is the substitute of all surds. In other words all aspirate letters become non-aspirate. The word जश् has been drawn into the _sutra_ by the word च 'also'.

Thus चिखनिषति ॥ Here सन् (Desiderative), is added to the root खन्, the ख is changed to छ by (VII. 4. 62), and this aspirate छ is now changed to non-aspirate by the present _sutra_. चिच्छिषति, टिठकारयिषति, तिष्ठासति, पिफकारयिषति, बुभूषति, जिघत्सति, डुढौकिषते ॥

If there is चर् (non-aspirate surd) in the original, it will remain of course unchanged. As, चिचीषति, टिटीकिषते, तितनिषति ॥

The original जश् also remains unchanged. Thus जिजनिषति, बुबुधे, ददौ, डिड्ये ॥ Or to be more accurate a चर् is replaced by a चर् and a जश् by a जश् letter.
