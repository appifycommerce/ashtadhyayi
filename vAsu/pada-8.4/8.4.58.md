sutra: अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः
vRtti: अनुस्वारस्य ययि परतः परसवर्ण आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the room of _anusvara_, when यय् follows, a letter homogeneous with the latter is substituted.

Thus शङ्किता, शङ्कितुम्, शङ्कितव्यम्, उञ्छिता, कुण्डिता, नन्दिता, कम्पिता &c. These are from roots शकि शङ्कायाम्, उञ्छि उञ्छे, कुदिदाहे, टुनदि समृद्धौ, कपि चलने ॥ Here नुम् is added because they are उदित्, and this न् becomes _anusvara_ by (VIII.3.24), and this _anusvara_ is changed to ङ् when followed by a guttural क् &c, to ञ् when followed by a palatal च &c, and so on to ण्, न् and म् ॥

Why do we say 'when यय् follows'? Observe आक्रंस्यते, आचिक्रंस्यते ॥

In कुर्वन्ति, वृषन्ति, the न is not changed into ण, though required by (VIII.4.2). Because the णत्व is _asiddha_, and therefore by the prior rule (VIII.3.24), the न is first changed into _anusvara_ (VIII.2.1). That _anusvara_ is again changed into न by the present rule, न being homogeneous with त ॥ This change again being असिद्ध as if it had never taken place (VIII.2.1), the ण is never substituted for न ॥
