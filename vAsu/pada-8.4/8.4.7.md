sutra: अह्नोऽदन्तात्
vRtti: अदन्तं यत्पूर्वपदं तत्स्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्याह्नो नकारस्य णकार आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The ण is the substitute of न of अहन्, when it is preceded by a word ending in अ, having in it a letter capable of producing the change."

Thus पूर्वाह्णः "fore-noon"; अपराह्णः "after-noon".

Why do we say "ending in अ"? Observe, निरह्नः, दुरह्नः ॥

The word अह्न is substituted for अहन् by (V. 4. 88). The word अह्न being used in the _sutra_ as ending in अ, the rule does not apply to other words. Thus दीर्घाह्नी शरत् ॥ The word अह्नः in the _sutra_ is in the nominative case, and should not be construed as the genitive of अहन्, because all _sthanins_ are exhibited in Nominatives as, वनं (VIII. 4. 4), वाहनं (VIII. 4. 8), यानं &c. The compounding takes place by (II. 2. 1), then is added the _samasanta_ affix टच् (V. 4. 91), and अह्न substitution by (V. 4. 88). The word दीर्घाह्नी is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound and not a _Tatpurusha_, and hence the affix टच् does not apply to it. The feminine ङीप् is added by (IV. 1. 28), there is elision of अ of अहन् by (VI. 4. 134).
