vRtti_eng: आ, ऐ and औ are called _vriddhi_.

This defines the word _vriddhi_. The letters आ, ऐ and औ are _vriddhi_ letters. The _sutra_ consists of three words _vriddhi_, _ât_ and _aich_. आत् means the long आ, the final त् being indicatory only, and is for the sake of the _pratyâhâra_ _aich_, and the _pratyâhâra_ ऐच् means the letters ऐ and औ.

The indicatory त् in आत् serves the purpose of showing that the very form आ having two _måtrâs_ or prosodial measure, is to be taken. This त् also joins with the succeeding vowels ऐ and औ by the rule of तपर (1.1.70) or that "which precedes or succeeds त्" and indicates that these vowels must be taken as having two _mâtrâs_ only, though they may be the result of the combination of vowels whose aggregate _mâtrâs_ may be more than two. A short vowel has one _måtrâ_, a long vowel has two, and a consonant has half a _mátrâ_. Thus by a rule of arm or euphonic conjunction of letters आ+आ=आ, as महा + आशयः = महाशयः. Here हा has two _mâtrâs_ and not four. So also खट्वैडकः the vowel ऐ the resultant of आ+ऐ has only two, not four, _mâtrâs_.

Thus the initial vowels in the following secondary derivative nouns are _vriddhi_ forms of their primitive vowels. आङ्गः "bodily", from अङ्गः; 'body' ऐच्छिकः "optional", from इच्छा "option"; औपगवः "the son of _Upagu_", from the word उपगुः meaning "a sage called _Upagu_". Similarly in शालीयः "belonging to the house" the आ is radical, and is also called _vriddhi_. The word _vriddhi_ occurs in _sûtras_ like सिचिवृद्धिपरस्मैपदेषु (7.2.1) "Let the final इक् of the base get _vriddhi_ substitute before the affix सिच् of the _Parasmaipada_".
