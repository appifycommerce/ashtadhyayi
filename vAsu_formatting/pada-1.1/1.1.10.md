sutra: नाज्झलौ
vRtti: तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नावपि अज्झलौ परस्परं सवर्णसंज्ञौ न भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: There is however no homogeneity between vowels and consonants, though their place and effort be equal.

This _sutra_ lays down an exception to the former _sutra_. There can be no homogeneity or _savarna_ relationship between vowels and consonants, though their आस्य and प्रयत्न may be the same. Thus इ and श have the same आस्य namely तालु 'palate,' and the same प्रयत्नः namely _vivrita_, but still they are not to be called _savarna_. Thus in दण्डहस्त, दधिशीतलं &c., the letters अ and ह in the first example, and इ and श in the second not being homogeneous letters; there is no combination or _sandhi_, which would otherwise have taken place.

Similarly if श and इ be held homogeneous, then विपाश+अण् (4.3.53) = विपाश्+अण् (6.4.148); here श would be elided by (6.4.148), but it is not so and we have वैपाशः "belonging to _vipåså_ or born therein." So also in आनडुहं "ox-skin," the ह would have been omitted, if held homogeneous with अ.
