sutra: न धातुलोप आर्द्धधातुके
vRtti: धात्वेकदेशो धातुस्तस्य लोपो यस्मिन्नार्द्धधातुके तदार्द्धधातुकं धातुलोपं तत्र ये गुणवृद्धी प्राप्नुतस्ते न भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Guna_ and _vriddhi_ substitutions, which otherwise would have presented themselves, do not take place, when such an _ardhadhatuka_ (III.4.114) affix follows, which causes a portion of the root to be elided.

This is an exception to _sūtra_ 3. By that _sūtra_ _iks_ were to be _gunated_ or _vriddhied_ and by _sūtra_ (7.3.84), the root is to be _gunated_ before all _ardhadhatuka_ terminations. All primary affixes, that are applied directly to roots in Sanskrit, are divided into two broad classes, called _sårvadhâtuka_ and _årdhadhâtuka_. The affixes marked with an indicatory श (called शित्), and the conjugational affixes, such as तिप्, तः &c., (called तिङ्) are _sårvadhatuka_; all other affixes are called _årdhadhâtuka_.

Though by the general rule, (7.3.84), the root is to be _gunated_ before _årdhadhâtuka_ terminations, yet it is not to be so, before those affixes which cause the लोप 'lopping off or ellipses' of a portion or a member of the original _dhấtu_. Thus the termination स्यामि is a first person singular termination of the future tense ( लृट् ) and is an _ardhadhâtuka_ termination; when this is added to root जि 'to excel' the इ of जि becomes _gunated_ and we have जेष्यामि "I shall or will excel." But in those cases where there is a _lopa_ of the member of a root form, caused by an affix, there is no _guṇation_. Thus in लोलुवः "a great cutter", the original root is लू "to cut" which forms the Intensive verb लोलूय. In forming the noun of agency from the verb लोलूय, an _ardhadhatuka_ suffix अच् (3.1.134), is added. Thus लोलूय+अच्. At this stage, by force of _sūtra_ (2.4.74) which declares that "before the affix अच् (3.1.134) the य of the Intensive verb must be suppressed," the _ya_ is dropped and we have लोलू+अ. Here by the general rule (7.3.84), the final ऊ would have been _gunated_. But by virtue of the present _sūtra_, no _guna_ takes place, because here on account of the _ardhadhâtuka_ affix अच्, a portion of the root, namely, य, has been elided; therefore no _guņa_ takes place. Thus we have लोलुवः "a great cutter."

The word धातु "root" has been used in the _sûtra_, in order to indicate that the exception does not apply where there is an elision of an _anubandha_ or of an affix. As in लूञ्+इता = लो+इता = लविता. Here the indicatory letter ञ् has been elided, but that does not prevent _gunation_. Similarly in रेड् the affix विच् is added to the root रिष् "to injure." Thus रिष्+विच् (3.2.75) = रिष्+व् (1.3.2) and (1.3.3) = रिष्+० (6.1.67). Here the affix व् is elided, but nevertheless, the _guṇa_ substitute must take place in रिष्. Thus we have रिष्+० = रेष् (7.3.86) and (1.1.62) = रेड् (8.2.39).

The word _ardhadhâtuka_ has been used to indicate that a _sarvadhatuka_ affix which causes the elision of a portion of a root, does not prevent _guna_ or _vriddhi_ as in रोरवीति, (_Rig Veda_ 4.58.3) "he roars much". रू+यङ् = रोरुव (3.1.22). रोरुय+तिप् = रोरु+ति (2.4.74). Here the _sarvadhatuka_ affix तिप् causes the elision of य, a portion of the root. The _guna_ substitution however takes place, and we have रोरो+ई+ति (7.3.94) = रोरवीति, the augment ईट् being added by _sūtra_ (7.3.94).

The word "_ikah_" of the previous _sūtra_ is understood in this _sūtra_ also. The _ik_ letters only are not _gunated_ or _vriddhied_ before such _ardhadbatuka_ affixes; the other vowels may do so. Thus in अभाजि the equation is as follows:- अ+भञ्ज्+चिण् = अ+भज्+इ (6.4.33). Here the _ardhadhátuka_ affix चिण् has caused a portion of the root भञ्ज्, to be suppressed, vis., the letter ञ् has been elided. But nevertheless the अ of भज् is _vriddhied_ before चिण् because अ is not included in the _pratyahara_ _ik_ ; and the exception contained in the present _sutra_ only applies to the _ik_ letters. So also रञ्ज्+घञ् (3.3.18) = रज्+अ (6.4.27) = रागः (7.2.116) and (7.3.52).
