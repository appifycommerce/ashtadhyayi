This _sutra_ explains the force of words in the ablative case when employed in these aphorisms. As the locative case refers to a preceding word, so the ablative refers to a succeeding word.

Thus _sutra_ (8.4.61) declares that 'after उद्, of _stha_ and _stambha_, the substitute is a letter belonging to the class of the prior.' Thus उद् + स्थानम्. Here the word उदः is exhibited in the original _sutra_ in the ablative case, and by the present _sutra_ it means that a dental letter थ् must be substituted in the place of _sthana_, and by (1.1.54) _ante_, this dental takes the place of स्; we have उद् + थ्थानम् = उत्थ्-थानम्. Similarly in _sutra_ तिङ् ङतिङः(8.2.18), 'a word ending in a conjugational affix, when following after a word ending in a non-conjugational affix, becomes _anudatta_.') Here the word '_atinah_' is exhibited in the ablative case, therefore, the operation directed by this aphorism, namely, the substitution of _anudatta_ accent, must take place in the word that follows. Thus ओदनं पचति; but not so in पचत्योदनमिति ॥
