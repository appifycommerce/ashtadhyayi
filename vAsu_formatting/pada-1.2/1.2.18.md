sutra: न क्त्वा सेट्
vRtti: क्त्वाप्रत्ययः सेण्न किद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _ktva_ when it takes the augment इट् (i.e. when it is _set_) is not _kit_.

We had had occasion to refer to this _sutra_ in explaining _sutra_ (1.2.7). The affix _ktva_ (the actual affix being _tva_, the _k_ being merely _it_ or indicatory letter) is on the face of it a _kit_ affix. This _sutra_ however limits its _kitness_ to cases where it is not _set_. If it is _set_, i.e. has before it the intermediate इ it will not be treated like a _kit_ affix. Thus in कृत्वा, हुत्वा, the affix त्वा is added directly to the root कृ 'to do' and हु 'to sacrifice,' without an intermediate इ and therefore the root has not been _gunated_, the affix here being _kit_. But in स्वेदित्वा, देवित्वा, वर्त्तित्वा, from स्विद्, दिव् and वृत् 'to sweat,' 'to shine,' 'to be,' the affix is not _kit_, because there is an intermediate इ before त्वा and the root has been consequently _gunated_.

Of course this _sutra_ relates to क्त्वा _ktva_ only. Other affixes though having an intermediate इ will be treated as _kit_, if they have an indicatory क्. Thus the affix क्तिन् (3.3.94) by which feminine nouns are formed from roots is a कित् affix. This affix when सेट्, will remain कित्, as नि + ग्रह् + इट् + क्तिन् = नि + गृह् + इ + ति (6.1.16) = निगृहीतिः (7.2.37). Here there is _samprasarana_ by treating _klin_ as _kit_. So also in उपस्निहितिः and निकुचितिः there is no _guna_. After ग्रह् &c., the affix क्तिन् takes the augment इट् by a _Vartika_ under _sutra_ (7.2.9) which see.
