sutra: सार्वधातुकमपित्
vRtti: सार्वधातुकं यदपित्तन्ङिद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A _Sarvadhatuka_ (III. 4. 113) affix not having an indicatory प् is like _nit_.

---
The terminations which are added to roots are either _Sarvadhatuka_ or _ardhadhatuka_. The _Sarvadhatuka_ terminations are all those that are marked with a श् and also the tense terminations called तिङ्, the latter are the following:-

_Parasmaipada_

- 3rd Person. तिप् तस् झि
- 2nd Person. सिप् थस् थ
- Ist Person. मिप् वस् मस्

_Atmanepada_

- 3rd Person. त आताम् झ
- 2nd Person. थास् आथाम् ध्वम्
- Ist Person. इट् वहि महिङ्

Except the terminations marked with a प् such as ति, सि and मि, &c., all the other _Sarvadhatuka_ terminations are ङित्. The शित् terminations like शतृ, शानच्, &c., are also _Sarvadhatuka_ terminations. These affixes are also ङित्, unless they have a प् as indicatory, as शप्. Thus the affix as तस्, being an अपित् _Sarvadhatuka_ affix, is a ङित्, and before it the vowel is not _gunated_ e. g. कुरुतः 'they two do.' The equation is :- कृ + उ + तस् (the उ is added by Rule (3.1.79)) = कर् + उ + तस् (6.4.110) = कुरु + तस् = कुरुतः ॥ Similarly कुर्वन्ति 'they do.'

Here the अ of कर् is changed into उ and we have कुर्, by virtue of rule (6.4.110), which declares that the अ of the verb कर् is changed into उ before those _Sarvadhatuka_ affixes which are ङित् or कित्. Here तस् is a _Sarvadhatuka_ ङित् affix by the present rule, and hence the change.

These four _sutras_ describe the ङित् terminations.

Why do we say 'a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix'? Because an _ardhadhatuka_ affix, though not being marked with an indicatory प् will not be a ङित्. As कर्त्ता 'doer,' कर्तुम् 'to do,' कर्तव्यम् 'duty.'

Why do we say 'not having an indicatory प्'? If a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix has an indicatory प् it will not be _nit_. As कृ + उ + तिप् = करोति 'he does' करोषि 'thou doest,' करोमि 'I do.'
