sutra: अकर्मकाच्च
vRtti: उपपूर्वात् तिष्ठतेरकर्मकादकर्मकक्रियावचनादात्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _stha_, preceded by _upa_, when used intransitively, the _Atmanepada_ affix is used.

As भोजनकाले उपतिष्ठते 'he stands ready at the time of dinner,' यावदभुक्तमुपतिष्ठते 'he is present whenever it is dinner time,' यावदोदनमुपतिष्ठते 'he is present whenever there is food, that is he comes at the time of dinner.' The word _bhukta_ is formed by adding the affix _kta_ to the root, and has the force of condition' here.

The phrase 'when used in the Intransitive' governs the three succeeding _sutras_ also.

If it is transitive; the verb _upastha_ takes the _parasmaipada_ terminations. As राजानमुपतिष्ठते 'he approaches the king.'
