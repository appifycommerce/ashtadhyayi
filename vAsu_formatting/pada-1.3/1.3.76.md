sutra: अनुपसर्गाञ्ज्ञः
vRtti: अनुपसर्गाज्जानातेः कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले आत्मनेपदं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verb _jna_ when not preceded by any _upasarga_, the terminations are of the _Atmanepada_, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent.

---
The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is understood in this _sutra_ also. Thus गां जानीते 'he recognises the cow as his own'; अश्वं जानीते 'he recognises the horse as his own.'

Why do we say when not preceded by any _upasarga_ ? For when compounded with prepositions, it may take the _Atmanepada_ terminations; as स्वर्गं लोकं न प्रजानाति मूढः 'the fool does not know the heavenly regions.'

When, however, the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the simple root ज्ञा takes _parasmaipada_ terminations. देवदत्तस्य गां जानाति 'he recognises _Devadatta_'s cow.'
