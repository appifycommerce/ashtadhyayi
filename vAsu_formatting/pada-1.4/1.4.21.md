sutra: बहुषु बहुवचनम्
vRtti: बहुषु बहुवचनम् भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In expressing multeity, a Plural case affix is employed.

---
When it is intended to denote multeity those affixes should be employed after nouns and verbs, which denote plural number. Thus ब्राह्मणाः पठन्ति, The _Brahmins_ read.

This rule applies to words which are capable of expressing numbers. Indeclinables (_Avyaya_) do not admit of numbers, and consequently they are always in singular number which is the general form.
