sutra: वरणार्थाना मीप्सितः
vRtti: वारणार्थानां धातूनां प्रयोगे य ईप्सितोऽर्थः तत्कारकमपादानसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the case of verbs having the sense of 'preventing', the desired object from which one is prevented or warded off is called Ablation or _Apadana_ _karaka_.

---
The obstruction to one's natural inclination is called _varana_ or prevention. As यवेभ्यो गां वारयति or निवर्तयति he wards off or withholds the cow from the barley.

Why do we say 'the object desired' is put in the ablative case' ? Observe गां वारयति क्षेत्रे he wards off the cow in the field.
