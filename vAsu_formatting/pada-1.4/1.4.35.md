sutra: धारे रुत्तमर्णः
vRtti: धारयतेः प्रयोगे उत्तमर्णौ योऽर्थ स्तत्कारकं संप्रदानसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the case of the verb _dhari_ 'to owe,' the creditor is called _Sampradana_.

---
The word उत्तमर्ण is compounded of two words उत्तम best and ऋण debt meaning (whose debt is best) creditor, as opposed to अधमर्ण debtor. As देवदत्ताय शतं धारयति he owes hundred to _Devadatta_.

Why do we say 'the creditor is called Recipient'? Observe देवदत्ताय शतं धारयति ग्रामे he owes hundred to _Devadatta_ in the village. Here village is in the Locative case.
