vRtti: राधेरीक्षेश्चकारकं संप्रदानसंज्ञं भवति कीदृशं यस्य विप्रश्नः, विविधः प्रश्नः, विप्रश्नः स कस्य भवति यस्य शुभाशुभं पृछ्यते ॥

The word _viprasna_ means literally asking various questions; and denotes questioning about the good or bad luck of another. Thus देवदत्ताय राध्यति ईक्षते गर्गः _Garga_ is favorable to or looks to _Devadatta_, the sense is that being casually asked by _Devadatta_, he reflects upon the good or bad fortune of _Devadatta_.

Another explanation of this _sutra_ is, the agent that puts various questions is put in the dative case, As शिष्याय राध्नोति or ईक्षते वा गुरुः meaning, the pupil asks the teacher various questions to resolve his doubts, and the teacher answers those questions to the pupil.
