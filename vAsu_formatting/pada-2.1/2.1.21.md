sutra: अन्यपदार्थे च संज्ञायाम्
vRtti: नदीभिः सह सुबन्तमन्यपदार्थे वर्तमानं संज्ञायां विषये समस्यते अव्ययीभावश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A word ending in a case-affix is compounded with words denoting the names of rivers, when the compouud word denotes a thing other than that expressed by the terms of the compound, and is an appellative ; the compound so formed being an _Avyayibhåva_.

The _anuvritti_ of the word _samkhyå_ does not extend to this _sutra_. Though this rule is given in the sub-division relating to optional compounds it is, however, a _Nitya-samasa_ rule : for no Name (सञ्ज्ञा) can ever be expressed by a sentence, and that being so, these compounds can never be analysed. As उन्मत्तगङ्गम् ' the country called _Unmatta Ganges_ .' So also लोहितगङ्गम्, कृष्णगङ्गम् ; शनैर्गङ्गम्.

Why do we say 'when it denotes a thing other than that expressed by the component parts of the compound' ? Observe कृष्णवेण the 'river _Krishnavena_.'

Why do we say 'when it expresses an Appellative' ? Observe शीर्घो गङ्गो देशः ' the country where the _Ganges_ moves rapidly.'
