sutra: खट्वा क्षेपे
vRtti: खट्वाशब्दो द्वितीयान्तः क्तान्तेन सह क्षेपे गम्यमाने समस्यते, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _khatwå_ in the accusative case is compounded with a word ending in the affix _kta_, when censure is implied, and the compound so formed is _Tat purusha_.

The word क्षेप means 'censure,' 'blame' and this sense can be connoted only by the compound word as a whole and not by any of its constituent elements. This compound is also, therefore, a _Nitya_ Compound, though it occurs in the sub-division relating to Optional Compounds :-because it is impossible to analyse such a compound and express, by means of sentence, the sense conveyed by the function of the compound word.

As खट्वारूढः or खट्वाप्लुतः (literally lying on a bed); silly, stupid, going wrong or astray.

There is no compounding when 'censure is not meant.' As खठ्वामारूढः 'lying on a bed.'

Why this word should have this opprobrious meaning, will be understood from the consideration of the following facts :-a person under the _Aryan_ social polity, could only then enter the married state or the life of a house-holder, as it was called, when he had completed his _Brahmacharya_ i.e., the prescribed period of bachelor studentship. All _Brahmacharis_ were bound to sleep on ground and not on खट्वा or cots, so long as they were _Brahmacharis_. A person who without completing his studies, and without obtaining the permission of his teacher, entered into matrimony, was originally called, in reproach, खट्वारूढः 'who had ascended the couch in an improper way.' Then the term was extended to all persons guilty of vile action.
