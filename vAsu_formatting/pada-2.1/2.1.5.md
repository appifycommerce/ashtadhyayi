sutra: अव्ययीभावश्च
vRtti: यानित ऊर्द्ध्वमनुक्रमिष्यामोऽव्ययीभावसंज्ञा स्ते वेदितव्याः॥
vRtti_eng: From this forward whatever we shall describe will get the name of _Avyayibháva samasa_ or adverbial compound.

This is also an  _adhikara_ aphorism like the last. As far as _sūtra_ 21, the compounds treated of, will get the designation of _Avyayibhava_. The word अव्ययीभाव like the word कर्मप्रवचनीय is a self-descriptive term, and not an arbitrary term like डि,धि  &c. When that which was not an indeclinable becomes an indeclinable, it is called stain or 'becoming an indeclinable'. In the _Avyayibhava_ compound the sense of the first of its elements is the main one or the independent one on which the other depends.
