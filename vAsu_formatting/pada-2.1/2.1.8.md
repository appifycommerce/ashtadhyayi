sutra: यावदवधारणे
vRtti: यावदित्येतदव्ययमवधारणे वर्तमानं सुपा सह समस्यते, अव्ययीभावश्च समासो भवति॥
vRtti_eng: The indeclinable word _yárat_ when it signifies limitation, is invariably compounded with a word ending in a case-affix which is in construction with it, and the compound so formed is called _Avyayibhåva_.

The word अवधारण means accurate ascertainment, restriction or limitation. As, यावदमत्रं ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयस्व invite so many _Bráhmanas_ only and not more as there are pots': i.e., if there are five pots then invite five _Bráhmans_; if six pots, then invite six _Bráhmans_. 

Why do we say ‘when meaning limitation'? Observe यावद्दत्तं तावत् भुक्तम् ‘I ate so long as it was given to me,' i.e. I do not know for certainty how much I have eaten.
