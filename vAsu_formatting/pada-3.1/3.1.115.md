sutra: भिद्योद्ध्यौ नदे
vRtti: भिदेरुज्झेश्च क्यप् निपात्यते नदेऽभिधेये ॥
vRtti_eng: The words भिद्य and उद्ध्य are irregularly formed by the affix क्यप्, when meaning a 'river'.

---
Thus भिद् + क्यप् = भिद्यः 'a river that breaks its banks by the rush of its water', the name of the _Bhidya_ river.

ऊज्झ् + क्यप् = उद्ध्य 'a river whose waters overflow the banks', name of the _Uddhya_ river; the झ is changed into ध.

When not meaning or qualifying the river, the regular forms are used; thus भेत्ता and उज्झिता.
