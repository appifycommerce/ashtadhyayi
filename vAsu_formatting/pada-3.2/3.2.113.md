sutra: न यदि
vRtti: यच्छब्द सहितेऽभिज्ञावचन उपपदे लृट्प्रत्ययो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix लृट् (the 2nd future) is not applied in the sense of the past. When the _upapada_ denoting recollection has in connection with it the particle यत्.

This prohibits लृट् which the verb वस् obtained from the last _sutra_. As अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत् कश्मीरेष्ववसाम 'thou rememberest _Devadatta_ how we did dwell in _Kashmir_'. Here the mere fact of dwelling is recollected, there being no other idea implied; therefore the subsequent aphorism has no scope here. That aphorism has its scope, when with recollection, is added another dependent idea or action, without which the sentence is not complete.
