sutra: ननौ पृष्टप्रतिवचने
vRtti: ननुशब्द उपपदे प्रश्नपूर्वके प्रतिवचने भूतेऽर्थे लट्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix लट् is employed after a verb in denoting past action, when the word ननु is in connection with it, and an answer is given to a question.

The _anuvritti_ of the words '_anadyatana_' and '_paroksha_' does not extend to this _sutra_. This declares a rule with regard to past time in general. This debars लुङ् (the Aorist tense). As अकार्षीः कटं देवदत्त ? -- ननु करोमि भोः '_Devadatta_, did you make the mat? O, yes, I did make it'. अवोचस्तत्र किञ्चिद् देवदत्त,- - ननु ब्रवीमि भोः '_Devadatta_, did you speak there anything? O, yes, I did speak'.

Why do we say 'in reply to an interrogation'? Observe नन्वकार्षीन्  माणवकः 'certainly, _Manavaka_ did it'.
