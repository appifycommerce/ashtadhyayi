sutra: पुवः संज्ञायाम्
vRtti: पवतेर्धातोः करणे कारके इत्रप्रत्ययो भवति समुदायेन चेत्संज्ञा गम्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix इत्र comes after the verb पू 'to purify' with the sense of the agent so expressed being the instrument; when the sense of the complete word is simply appellative, and not descriptive.

The verb पू includes two verbs पूङ् and पूञ् both meaning 'to purify', but belonging to two different conjugations; as पवित्रं an instrument for cleansing or purifying, such as a sieve or a strainer; and in this sense it means 'two blades of _Kusa_ grass used at sacrifices in purifying and sprinkling _ghee_'. It also means 'the sacred thread, the clarified butter, &c'.
