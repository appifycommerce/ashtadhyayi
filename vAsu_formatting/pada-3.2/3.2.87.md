sutra: ब्रह्मभ्रूणवृत्रेषु क्विप्
vRtti: ब्रह्मादिषु कर्मसूपपदेषु हन्तेर्द्धातोः क्विप्प्रत्ययो भवति भूते ॥
vRtti_eng: 'The affix क्विप् comes after the verb हन् ''to kill'' with the sense of past time, when the following words in the accusative case are in composition: ब्रह्म ''a _Brahmana_'', भ्रूण ''a foetus'' and वृत्र ''_Vritra_''.'

As ब्रह्महन्, 1st. sing. ब्रह्महा 'who has killed a _Brahmana_'; भ्रूणहा 'who has killed a foetus'; वृत्रहा 'who has killed _Vritra_, a name of _Indra_'.

Since by _sutra_ 76 _ante_, the affix क्विप् was ordained to come after all verbs, and therefore would have come after the verb हन् also, where is the necessity of the present aphorism? This aphorism makes a _niyama_. i.e. the verb हन् takes the affix क्विप् only when it is in composition with the words ब्रह्म &c. Four-fold restriction is here intended.

(1) When हन् has _upapada_, the words ब्रह्म &c., and not any other word; as पुरुषं हतवान् 'he has killed the man'.

(2) When the words ब्रह्म &c. are _upapadas_ of any other verb than हन्, then this affix is not employed; so that the verb must be हन्; thus ब्रह्माधीतवान् 'he has read the _Veda_'.

(3) The क्विप् is the only affix to denote past time in the case of हन् preceded by ब्रह्म &c., and no other affix can be employed in this sense.

(4) This is employed only in the past tense and not in any other tense; as ब्रह्माणं हन्ति or हनिष्यति 'he kills or will kill the _Brahmana_'. This _sutra_ anticipates the diversity taught in the next _sutra_, and is an example of बहुलं use of the affix.
