sutra: उपसर्गे च संज्ञायाम्
vRtti: उपसर्गे चोपपदे जनेर्डः प्रत्ययो भवति संज्ञायां विषये ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ड comes after the verb जन् with a past signification, when an _upasarga_ is in composition and when the sense is simply appellative.

---
The term here being simply appellative, and not descriptive, cannot be explained by giving the signification of its component elements. As प्रजाः 'people', or 'a son'; as in the sentence अथेमा मानवी प्रजाः ।
