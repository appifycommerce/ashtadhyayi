sutra: समुच्चये सामान्यवचनस्य
vRtti: द्वितीये लोड् विधाने समुच्चये सामान्यवचनस्य धातोरनुप्रयोगः कर्तव्यः ॥
vRtti_eng: In the second case (III. 4. 3) where many actions are spoken of together, the verb that is made to follow, should be such as has the sense common to all those verbs.

Thus ओदनं भुङ्क्ष्व, सक्तून्पिब, धानाः खादेत्येवायमभ्यवहरति 'he takes his meals, eating rice, drinking _saktu_, and tasting fried corn'. Here the verb अभ्यवहरति has a sense common to all the verbs in the Imperative mood. The object of taking the second verb, having the senses common to all the antecedent verbs, is to prevent the repetition of all the previous ones. In the secular vernacular, the brevity, however, is often not approved.
