This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_ pure and simple. The phrase 'when feminine nature is to be indicated', must be read in all the following aphorisms upto 81 inclusive. The _anuvritti_ of the word '_pratipadika_' should be read into this _sutra_, from the first _sutra_, not so, however, the _anuvritti_ of the words 'ङी-आप्'; for we are now going to form words by the application of ङी and आप् affixes.
