sutra: दीर्घजिह्वी च छन्दसि
vRtti: दीर्घजिह्वी इति छन्दसिविषये निपात्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The form दीर्घजीह्वी 'long-tongued' is irregularly formed in the _Chhandas_.

---
The word दीर्घजीह्वी is the feminine of दीर्घजीह्व but as the latter has a conjunct consonant for its penultimate, the feminine affix ङीष् would not have applied to it by (4.1.54). The present aphorism enjoins ङीष् ॥ Thus दीर्घजीह्वी in the sentence दीर्घजीह्वी वै देवानां हव्यमलेट् ।

The word च 'and' in the aphorism is used in order to draw in the word संज्ञा from the last, so that the word _dirgha_-jihvi is always a Name. Moreover by using the feminine form _dirgha_-jihvi in the _sutra_, it is indicated that the application of ङीष् is necessary and not optional, as was the case in the last _sutras_.
