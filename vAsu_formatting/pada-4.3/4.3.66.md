sutra: तस्य व्याख्यानइति च व्याख्यातव्यनाम्नः
vRtti: तस्येति षष्ठीसमर्थाद् व्याख्यातव्यमाम्नः प्रातिपदिकाद्व्याख्याने ऽभिधेये यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति तत्र भवे च ॥
vRtti_eng: After the name of a subject of commentary, an affix comes in the sense of 'its commentary', as well as, in the sense of 'what occurs there'.

---
That by which a thing is explained is called व्याख्यान or 'commentary'. The name of a thing explainable is called व्याख्यातव्यनाम ॥ After such a name, being in the 6th case in construction, the affix is added. The affix means तस्यव्याख्यानं as well as तत्रभव, the latter being read into the _sutra_ by virtue of च ॥

Thus सुपां व्याख्यानः = सौपो ग्रन्थः '_Saupa_, a book on the explanation of case-affixes'. So also '_Tainga_-- a Commentary on Verbal affixes' कार्तः '_Karta_-- a Commentary on _krit_ affixes'. सौप &c. may also mean सुप्सु भवं &c.

Why do we say व्याख्यातव्यनाम्नः 'after the name of the thing explainable'? The thing to be explained must be a Book, therefore, the affix will not apply to the name of a city &c. For example, if a model be made to describe the city of _Pataliputra_, such a model will not be named after _Pataliputra_ by the addition of affix. Thus सुकोशला is a modal giving a description of _Pataliputra_. This will not be called _Pataliputram_.

The _anuvritti_ of भव and व्याख्यान runs simultaneosly in all the subsequent _apavada_ _sutras_, and hence we have read the _anuvritti_ of भव into this _sutra_ also.
