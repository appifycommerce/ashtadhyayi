sutra: ख च
vRtti: वेशोयशआदेर्भगान्तात्प्रातिपदिकान्मत्वर्थे खः प्रत्ययो भवति । योगविभागो यथासंख्यनिरासार्थ उत्तरार्थश्च । चकाराद्यत् ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ख also comes after the words '_vesobhaga_' and '_yasobhaga_', in the _Chhandas_, with the force of _matup_.

Thus देशोभगीनः and यशोभगीनः ॥ This _sutra_ has been separated from last in order to prevent the application of the यथासंख्य rule (1.3.10). For had the _sutra_ been वेशोयश आदेर्भगाद् यल्खौ, as it occurs in _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_, then the affix यल् would apply to देशोभग, and the affix ख to यशोभगः which is not what is intended. Another reason for making it a distinct aphorism is that the _anuvritti_ of ख runs in the next _sutra_, not so of यल् ॥
