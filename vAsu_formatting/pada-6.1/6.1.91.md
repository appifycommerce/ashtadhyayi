sutra: उपसर्गादृति धातौ
vRtti: आदित्येव । अवर्णान्तादुपसर्गादृकारादौ धातौ परतः पूर्वपरयोः स्थाने वृद्धिरेकादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Vriddhi_ is the single substitute when the अ or आ of a preposition (_upasarga_) is followed by the short ऋ of a verb.

The word आत् is understood here also. When a preposition ending in अ or आ is followed by a root beginning with ऋ, the _Vriddhi_ is the single substitute for the precedent अ or आ and the subsequent ऋ ॥ This debars the _guna_ taught in (6.1.87). Thus उप + ऋच्छति = उपार्च्छति, प्रार्च्छति, उपाध्रोति ॥ Why do we say 'after a preposition'? Observe खट्वर्च्छति, मालर्च्छति, प्रर्च्छकोदेशः = प्रगता ऋच्छका अस्माद् देशात् ॥ Here the word प्र is not treated as an _upasarga_, hence this _sutra_ does not apply. It is a _Gati_ here. Why do we say 'when ऋ follows'? Observe उप + इत = उपेतः ॥ Why have we used त् after ऋ indicating that short ऋ is to be taken? Observe उप + ऋकारी यति = उपर्कारीयति ॥ No option is allowed here by the subsequent _sutra_. The त् is used, in fact, for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_ in case of Denominative verbs, no ordinary verb can begin with a long ॠ ॥ Why have we employed the word धातु, when the word '_upasarga_' would have caused us to infer its correlative धातु? It is used in order to prevent the application of the rule (6.1.129) which causes प्रकृतिभावः or non-_sandhi_ of ऋ ॥ The repetition of '_Dhatu_' shows that the alternative _prakriti_ _bhava_ taught in (6.1.129), would not apply in the case of the ऋ of a _Dhatu_.
