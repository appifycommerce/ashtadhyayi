sutra: उपमानं शब्दार्थप्रकृतावेव
vRtti: उपमानवाचि पूर्वपदं शब्दार्थ प्रकृतावेव णिनन्त उत्तरपदमाद्युदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When the first member of a compound expresses that with which resemblance is denoted, then it has acute on the first syllable, before a word formed by णिनि affix, only then, when such latter word is a radical without any preposition, and means 'giving out a definite sound like so and so'.

The word उपमान means the object with which something is likened : means शब्दार्थ 'expressing a sound'; प्रकृति means 'root, without any preposition'. Thus उ꣡ष्ट्रक्रोशिन्, ध्वा꣡ङ्क्षराविन्, ख꣡रनादिन् ॥ The word उपमान shows the scope of this _sutra_ as distinguished from the last. So that, when the first term is an उपमान word, the preceding _sutra_ will not apply, though the second member may be a णिनि formed word. When the second term is not a word denoting sound, the rule will not apply. As वृकवञ्चि꣡न्, वृकप्रेक्षि꣡न् which retain _krit_ accent (6.2.139) Why do we say 'a radical word without any preposition'? Observe गर्दभोच्चारिन्, कोकिलभिष्याहारिन् ॥ Here the second terms radically (i.e. _charin_ and _harin_) do not denote sounds, but it is with the help of the Prepositions उत् and अभि, वि and आ that they mean sound. The force of एव is that the उपमान words are restricted. Such words get acute on the first syllable only then, when the second member is a radical sound name. According to _Patanjali_, the first syllable gets acute, whether it denotes उपमान or not, when the second word is a radical denoting sound. (शब्दार्थ प्रकृतौ ह्युपमानं चानुपमानं चाद्युदात्तमिष्यते) ॥ As पुष्कलजल्पिन्, for had एव not been used, the _sutra_ would have run thus: उपमानं शब्दार्थप्रकृतौ and would mean:--"If the second member is a sound denoting radical word, then the _upamana_ first member and no other will get the acute". But this is not what is intended : because when the second member is a sound-denoting radical, the first member will get the acute, whether it is _upamana_ word or not. The word एव therefore restricts _upamana_; i.e. a first member denoting उपमानं will get the accent then only, when the second term is a sound-denoting radical. If the second term is not a sound denoting radical, the first term denoting _upamana_ will not get the accent. The compounding takes place by (3.2.79).
