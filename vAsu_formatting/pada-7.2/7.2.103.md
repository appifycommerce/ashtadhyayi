sutra: किमः कः
vRtti: किम् इत्येतस्य क इत्ययमादेशो भवति विभक्तौ परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: क is substituted for किम् before a _vibhakti_ affix.

As कः, कौ, के ॥ The substitution takes place even when the augment अकच् is added. Therefore, the substitute is here क and not अ which latter would have been sufficient for किम् ॥ For म् of किम् being replaced by अ (7.2.102), the इ would be left, which would be replaced by अ, had the _sutra_ been किमोऽत् and the forms would have been the same (क् + अ + अ = क (6.1.97). See (5.3.1), (5.3.13) &c.
