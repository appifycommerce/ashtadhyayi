sutra: अचस्तास्वत्थल्यनिटो नित्यम्
vRtti: तासो ये नित्यानिटो धातवोऽजन्तास्तेभ्यस्तासाविव थलीडागमो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a root, which ends in a vowel, and after which the Periphrastic Future affix _tasi_ is always devoid of the augment इट्; (after such a root) थल् the personal ending of the Perfect, like तास्, does not also get the augment इट् ॥

---
Those vowel-ending roots in _Dhatupatha_ which are invariably _anit_ before the affix तास् (Periphrastic Future), are also _anit_ before the Perfect ending थल् ॥ As याता (Periphrastic Future), ययाथ (Periphrastic), चेता, चिचेथ, नेता, निनेथ; होता जुहोथ ॥ Why 'ending in a vowel'? Observe भत्ता, बिभेदिथ ॥ Why 'like तास्'? Observe लूत्वा but लुलविथ, Why 'थल'? Observe याता but ययिव, ययिम ॥ The word नित्यं qualifies अनिट्, if therefore तास् be optionally _anit_, then the थल् will be सेट् always. As तास् – विधोता or विधविता; the थल् is विदुधविथ ॥

Here इट् is optional before तास् by (7.2.44). Similarly चक्रमिथ, for क्रम् is _anit_ in _atmanepada_, and सेट् in _Parasmaipada_. In fact, whereever there is want of इट्, whether by complete prohibition or optional prohibition, all that is regulated by (7.2.13): this is the view adopted by the _Kasika_. But another view is that the prohibition of this _sutra_ applies to the इट् of (7.2.13) only, but does not debar the option of (7.2.44); so they have two forms विदुधोथ and विदुधविथ ॥ This view is applied by them to (7.2.46), as सस्वर्थ or सस्वरिथ (7.2.44).

Why have we used the word वत् in तास्वत् ? The force of वत् is that the root should have a form in तास् and then be _anit_; and if a root has no Periphrastic Future form, and thus its तास् is _anit_, such a root is not governed by this _sutra_. As जघसिथ and उवयिथ ॥ Here the roots घस् and वय् the substitutes अद् and वेञ् respectively have no Periphrastic Future form, and hence this rule does not apply to them.
