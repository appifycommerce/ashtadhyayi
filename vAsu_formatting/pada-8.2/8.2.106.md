sutra: प्लुतावैच इदुतौ
vRtti: दूराद्धूतादिषु प्लुतो विहितः तत्र ऐचः प्लुतप्रसङ्गे तदवयवभूताविदुतौ प्लुतौ ॥
vRtti_eng: In forming the _pluta_ of the diphthongs ऐ and औ, their last element इ and उ get the _pluta_.

---
The _pluta_ ordained by (8.2.84) &c. when applied to ऐ or औ, cause the prolation of the last element of these diphthongs namely of इ or उ ॥ The word प्लुतौ in the _sutra_ is Nominative dual of प्लुत, and the aphorism literally means "इ and उ are _pluta_ of the diphthongs ऐ and औ" ॥

Thus ऐ३तिकायन, औ३पगव ॥

The letters ऐ and औ are compound letters or diphthongs consisting of अ + इ and अ + उ ॥ In making the _pluta_ of these, the question arises, should both अ and इ (or उ) be prolated, or only the last element, or the first only. The present _sutra_ answers that doubt. If in the analysis of these letters, अ be taken as having one _matra_ (or moras), and इ and उ one _matra_, then the _pluta_ इ and उ will have two _matras_, so that the whole _pluta_ ऐ and औ will have three _matras_. In fact, the word प्लुत is used here as a Past Participle of प्लु, having the force of a verb; and इदुतौ प्लुतौ means इदुतौ प्लवेते i.e. वृद्धिं गच्छतः, i.e. इ and उ are lengthened. And इ and उ are lengthened to that extent, so as to make ऐ and औ of three _matras_. Thus when अ + इ and अ +  उ each has one _matra_, then the _pluta_ of इ and उ will have two _matras_ as we have said before. But when अ + इ (ए) and अ + उ (ओ) are considered to have अ half _matra_, and इ and उ one _matra_ and a half, then इ and उ are made _pluta_, so as to have two and a half (2 1/2)_matras_ each, thus the whole of ऐ and औ, has still three _matras_. In fact, the definition of _pluta_ is, that it is a vowel which has three _matras_: so that we should so prolate the vowel as to make it have three _matras_.

But according to _Patanjali_, this _pluta_ of ऐ and औ has four _matras_. Thus अ + इ and अ + उ each has one _matra_. The _pluta_ of इ and उ will have three _matras_. Thus अ + इ३ and अ + उ३. or the whole has four _matras_. According to this view a vowel may have four _matras_ also.
