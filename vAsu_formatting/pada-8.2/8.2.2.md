sutra: नलोपः सुप्स्वरसंज्ञातुग्विधिषु कृति
vRtti: नलोपः पूर्वत्रासिद्धो भवति सुब्विधौ स्वरविधौ संज्ञाविधौ तुग्विधौ च कृति । विधिशब्दोयं प्रत्येकमभिसंबध्यमानः स्वरसंज्ञातुकां विधेयत्वात्तैः कर्म्मषष्ठीयुक्तैर्भावसाधनोऽभिसंबध्यते । सुपा तु संबन्धसामान्यवचनषष्ठ्यन्तेन कर्म्मसाधनः  । तेन सुपः स्थाने यो विधिः सुपि च परभूते सर्वोसौ सुब्विधिरिति सर्वत्रासिद्धत्वं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The elision of a final न् (VIII. 2. 7) is considered as if not to have taken effect, in applying the following rules; (1) rules regarding case-endings, (2) rules regarding accents, (3) rules regarding any technical term of Grammar, and (4) rules regarding the augment त् before a _Krit_-affix.

The word विधि in the _sutra_ applies to all the four words preceding it: as सुब्विधि, स्वरविधि &c. The force of the Genitive compound in स्वरविधि, संज्ञाविधि, तुग्विधि is that of ordaining the existence of something: e.g. when an accent is to be given to a word, or a particular designation is to be given to it or when त् is to be added to it, (भावसाधन) ॥ The compound सुब्विधि means however, the rule relating to the case-endings themselves, as well as, the rule which would apply to a word, when a case-ending follows (कर्मसाधन) ॥

(1) सुब्विधि :- As राजभिः, तक्षभिः ॥ Here the elision of न् of राजन् and तक्षन् being _asiddha_, the भिस् is not changed to ऐस् by (7.1.9). So also राजभ्याम्, तक्षभ्यां, राजसु, तक्षसु ॥ Here the finals of राज and तक्ष are not lengthened before भ्यां by सुपिच (7.3.102) and nor changed to ए before सु by (7.3.103): as in नराभ्यां and नरेषु of the stem ending in अ ॥

(2) स्वरविधि :- As रा꣡जवती and not राजवती꣡ ॥ For the elision of न् being _asiddha_, the rule (6.1.220), does not apply, for the word is considered not to end in अवती but न्वती ॥ Similarly in पञ्चार्मम् and दशार्मम्, the elision of न being _asiddha_, the first member does not become _ady_-_udatta_ by (6.2.90). Similarly पञ्चवीजी : the elision of न् being _asiddha_, the first member does not retain its original accent as required by (6.2.29).

The word राजन् is first acute, as it is formed by the affix कनिन् (_Unadi_ I. 156). राजवती is formed by adding ङीप् to the मतुप् ending word, by (4.1.6). पञ्चार्मम् is a compound under rule (2.1.50) of पञ्चन् + अर्म, and when न् is elided, the first member becomes a word ending in अ and would require the accent of (6.2.90).

(3) संज्ञाविधि :- As पञ्च ब्राह्मण्यः, दश ब्राह्मण्यः ॥ The elision of म् being _asiddha_, the words पंच and दश are still called _shash_ though they no longer end in न् (ष्णान्ता षट् (1.1.24)). Being called षष्, they do not take टाप् in the feminine (4.1.10).

According to the _Vartikakara_, there is no necessity of using the word संज्ञा in the _sutra_ (संज्ञा ग्रहणानर्थक्यं च नन्निमित्तंत्वाल्लोपस्य), because the elision of न् is caused by reason of its having such a designation (as षट्). Thus without its having the name of षट् there would be no elision of जस् and शस्, without such elision, there is no _pada_ _sanjna_ of these words, and unless these words get _Pada_ designation, there can be no elision of न् by (8.2.7). The _shash_ designation, however, would not be retained by these words after taking plural affixes, when feminine affixes are to be added to them, but for this _sutra_. The पञ्चन् and दशन् ending in न् would require ङीप् in the feminine, which is however prohibited, for when जस् and न् are elided, the words end in अ and require टाप् for their feminine, which is also prohibited, because, by the present _sutra_ the word still retains its designation of षट् ॥

Question: How can this be the purpose of this _sutra_? There are two views as regard definitions (संज्ञा), the one is that a particular name is given to a thing once for all, prior to any operations; and operations are performed afterwards upon it or with it, as occasions arise. This view is embodied in the maxim यथोद्देशं संज्ञापरिभाषम् '_Sanjna_, and _Paribhashas_ remain where they are taught.' The other view is that the _sanjna_ _sutra_ is to be read with every particular operative _sutra_, and the _sanjna_ given to the word afresh, with every new operation. In other words, the _sanjna_ _sutra_ becomes identified with a _vidhi_ _sutra_, every time that a _vidhi_ is to be applied. This is embodied in the maxim कार्यकालं संज्ञापरिभाषम् "_Sanjnas_ and _Paribhasas_ are attracted by or unite with the rules that enjoin certain operations." In the first view, the षट् _sanjna_ will be good throughout, both for the purposes of eliding जस् and शस् and for prohibiting टाप् ॥ Hence thus _sutra_ is not necessary in that view. But in the other view, the _sutra_ is necessary. For if the view be taken that a _sanjna_ is to be applied with regard to each operation, then that षट् _sanjna_ which had taken effect for the purposes of eliding जस् and शस्, will no longer hold good for the purposes of preventing the application of the feminine affix. Hence, the word संज्ञा is taken in this _sutra_, to prevent the application of the second view.

(4) तुग्विधिः - Thus वृत्रहभ्यां, वृत्रहभिः ॥ On account of the elision of म् being _asiddha_, the तुक् augment is not added, though required by (6.1.71). (ह्रस्वस्य पिति कृति तुक्) ॥

Some hold that तुक् need not be read in the _sutra_. They argue in this way:- There is this maxim सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य "That which is taught in a rule, the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination". Now the elision of न् of वृत्रहन् took place because of the case affix भ्यां, this elision cannot be the cause of adding तुक् ॥ Or the तुक् being a बहिरङ्ग operation would be _asiddha_ with regard to the _antaranga_ elision of न् ॥ This opinion is, however, not sound. The employment of तुक् in this _sutra_ indicates, that the two maxims above referred to, are not of universal application i.e. they are _anitya_.

Why do we say before a _Krit_-affix? Observe वृत्रहच्छत्रम्, वृत्रहच्छाया ॥ Here तुक् is added by (6.1.73).

The elision of न् taught by (8.2.7) &c would be _asiddha_ by the general rule (8.2.1); the specification of the four cases in which it is _asiddha_ shows that it is a restrictive or _niyama_ rule. That is, the elision of न् is considered _asiddha_ only with regard to these four rules, and no other. It is not _asiddha_ in राजीयते (राजन् + क्यच् + ते = राज + य + ते = राजीयते) (3.1.8), (7.4.33). There would not have been long ई had the नलोप been _asiddha_. So also राजायते there is lengthening, (7.4.25) and राजाश्च there is _ekadesa_ (6.1.101).
