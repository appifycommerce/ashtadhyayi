sutra: ससजुषो रुः
vRtti: सकारान्तस्य पदस्य सजुष् इत्येतस्य च रुर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: For the final स् and for the ष् of सजुष् is substituted रु, at the end of a word.

Thus अग्निरत्र, वायुरत्र ॥ So also सजूर्ऋषिभिः, सजूर्देवेभिः ॥ सजुष् is derived from जुष् with the affix क्विप् and the preposition सह, which is changed to स in _Bahuvrihi_. The lengthening takes place by (8.2.76). and the word means सप्रीतिः ॥ The रु is र्, but it should be distinguished from it. This secondary र् (or रु) undergoes a distinct and separate _Sandhi_ change from that of the primary र् ॥
