sutra: एकाजुत्तरपदे णः
vRtti: एकाजुत्तरपदं यस्य स एकाजुत्तरपदः । तस्मिन्नेकाजुत्तरपदसमासे प्रातिपदिकान्तनुम्विभक्तिषु पूर्वपदस्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्य नकारस्य णकार आदेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In a compound, the second member of which is a monosyllable, there is ण in the room of न of the second member, provided that the न is at the end of a _pratipadika_, or is the augment नुम्, or occurs in a _vibhakti_; and when the first member contains a cause of change.

Thus वृत्रहणौ and वृत्रहणः 'the _Vritra_-killer'. क्षीरपाणि 'Drinkers of milk' : सुरापाणि 'drinkers of wine' : being examples of नुम् (7.3.88), क्षीरापेण and सुरापेण are examples of case-terminations.

Why the letter ण is repeated in this _sutra_, while its _anuvritti_ was understood from the context? It is repeated in order to show that this is not an optional rule, but an obligatory rule. In fact, it shows that the _anuvritti_ of वा 'optional' ceases, and does not extend further.
