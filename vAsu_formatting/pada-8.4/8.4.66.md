Thus अग्निम् + ईले = अग्नि॑मीले ॥ Here ई which was अनुदात्त by rule (8.1.28), becomes _svarita_ by the present rule, as it comes after the _udatta_ इ of _agni_.

So also गा꣡र्ग्यः॑, वा꣡त्स्यः॑ ॥ Here यञ् is added by (4.1.105), and being ञित् the words are first acute. The final is _anudatta_, which becomes _svarita_. So also प꣡च॑ति and प꣡ठ॑ति, the शप् and तिप् are _anudatta_, the root is accented, the अ of शप् becomes _svarita_.

The rule (6.1.158), does not change this _svarita_ into an _Anudatta_, because for the purposes of that rule, the present rule is असिद्ध, or as if it had not taken place (8.2.1). Therefore both the _udatta_ and the _svarita_ accent are heard.
